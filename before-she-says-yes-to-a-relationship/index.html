<p>Make sure, you ready are you. Find out is he dating someone currently. Check if has he made enough effort and do you love him or what you love what he did. If you were to date him will you complete him and what is his HIV status?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Birthday-1024x576.jpg" alt="Things every woman should do, before she says yes to a relationship" class="wp-image-680"></figure>



<p>Starting a relationship is a huge decision. But sometimes we just jump into a relationship without asking our self what am I getting myself into. Sometimes a relationship can work just fine. Though sometimes that can be a death sentence.</p>



<p>Just because a man came to you and told you what he wants. Doesn&rsquo;t mean he meant every word. The average men stop at least 3 girls per day and say the same words to all of them.</p>



<p>Now how can you easily trust a guy? I have found myself in a position where I talk to a girl, thinking I like her.</p>



<p>Then 3 weeks later, I don&rsquo;t want to be part of that relationship. Why? Sometimes we as guy enter a relationship just because someone looks good.</p>



<p>After we sleep with her that when we realize we never wanted a relationship.</p>



<p>As a female, you need to be careful before you start a relationship.</p>



<p><strong>Check yourself, check the person you are about to date!</strong></p>



<p>As you grow, you should worrier about wasting time. If you enter a relationship and a year later you realize it not for you.</p>



<p>You just wasted a year, and you are not getting any younger.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Is this man dealing with trust issues, emotional scares, or immaturity?</p>



<p>If you answer yes to any of these questions, that man may not be your best choice.</p>



<h2>How ready are you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-ready-are-you.jpg" alt="How ready are you" class="wp-image-687"></figure>



<p>If the prior relationship ended, it means somehow that relationship broke you.</p>



<p>Yes, the last relationship ended, but have you moved on?</p>



<p>If you are not ready, just tell a guy I&rsquo;m not ready. Stop entering a relationship with problems.</p>



<h2>Does he have a girlfriend?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Does-he-have-a-girlfriend.jpg" alt="Does he have a girlfriend? " class="wp-image-683"></figure>



<p>There is this strange thing most girls do. They ask after sex if you have a girlfriend or not. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If I say yes what different does is it make, we slept already?</p>



<p>&nbsp;You already have feelings for me? If a guy says I love you, you must find out if they have a boyfriend as easily as possibly.</p>



<p>Unless you are tolerable with being a side chick.</p>



<h2>Has the effort been established?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Has-the-effort-been-established.jpg" alt="Has the effort been established? " class="wp-image-685"></figure>



<p>Don&rsquo;t make it easy, even if you feel you love him. Make sure he will fight for this relationship.</p>



<p>If a guy doesn&rsquo;t fight to win a relationship, he will never fight to keep it.</p>



<p>A boyfriend or someone who is interested but doesn&rsquo;t make the effort to speak to you, or see you and show you he needs this to work.</p>



<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care. At the early stage of the relationship, a guy must cancel plans just to be with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A man who wants you should never be reminded to treat you the way you deserve to be treated.</p>



<p>If a guy makes excuses before you even say yes! Don&rsquo;t waste time, move on!</p>



<h2>Has he expressed how he feels about you</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Has-he-express-how-he-feels-about-you-.jpg" alt="Has he express how he feels about you " class="wp-image-684"></figure>



<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t wonder is he into you or not. He must express that to you. <strong>Don&rsquo;t assume</strong>!</p>



<p>Some women are ignorant, they believe some guy doesn&rsquo;t show emotions. Because of that how guys are wired. That the wrong stereotype.</p>



<p>Men express their romantic feelings, but not to every girl. If he expresses himself deeply you are special.</p>



<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t express himself, just know he knows how to. If you don&rsquo;t believe me wait until you do something wrong. He will express in every direction how what you did was wrong. If you think guys don&rsquo;t know how to express themself, think again!</p>



<h3>Stop relying on direct sighs like</h3>



<ul><li>The way he holds you.</li><li>The way he is always available when you need him.</li><li>The way he gives you money</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>While that can be a good sign it can miss lead you. Remember, we are talking about a guy you haven&rsquo;t said yes to.</p>



<p>He might do those things to sleep with you. You don&rsquo;t know if he has good intentions for you. Maybe after you sleep with him, he might start playing games with you.</p>



<p>Communicate like a human being. You are not an ape. Do you miss me and how do you feel about me? Those questions are wrong and the answer won&rsquo;t be honest.</p>



<p>To understand a guy, you must listen to him talking about you for several days. Paying attention to every word. Because some guys will even forget what they said the previous day and say something totally opposite. &nbsp;If he does that you know he doesn&rsquo;t mean what he is saying.</p>



<p>We as men are very romantic and we not afraid to tell you if we miss you. But if you must ask us if we miss you, then something is wrong. We can tell you what we see in you and if we can&rsquo;t express that.</p>



<p>Maybe we are not into you, we are just fooling around.</p>



<h2>Do you love him or something he did?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Do-you-love-him-or-it-something-he-did.jpg" alt="Do you love him or it something he did?" class="wp-image-682"></figure>



<p>Girls make many mistakes when they enter a relationship, and one of them is to say yes just because a guy did something.</p>



<p>Maybe just because he bought lunch. This why most relationship and marriages fail.</p>



<p>Once you take a girl out, she says yes. Once a guy does something she falls into a trap. Keep in mind we as guys know what you girls like and we do those things to win you easy.</p>



<p>But even so, as a girl you need to do your homework. Be sure if this is what you want. Know him, know his just past and more.</p>



<p>It is always good to write what you want in a man before you say yes.&nbsp; Understand if this man was to lose his job can you continue dating him. Can you learn something from him?</p>



<p>Jumping to things just because he did something once or twice. What if you jump in and a week later you realize he is abusive?</p>



<p>What if he can do nice things, but he is controlling as hell?</p>



<p>Do your homework, take your time look into him. Visit his social media to learn what type of person he is. Does he flirt with every girl?</p>



<p><strong>You must know all that to make a wise decision.</strong></p>



<p>My aim is to help you stop wasting time with the relationship that will fail in no time.</p>



<p>Without the magic of chemistry, a relationship can&rsquo;t sustain itself. If you say yes for the wrong reasons, you will be bored in that relationship and you will regret your decision.</p>



<p>Men who give you everything turn to do as they please. Most girls can allow them, but soon or late they realize they deserve better.</p>



<p>You can avoid all that drama and enter the relationship for the right reasons.</p>



<h3>What are the right reasons to enter a relationship?</h3>



<ul><li>To share, love</li><li>To learn and grow together</li><li>To have children with the right person</li><li>Friendship and fun</li><li>Mutual support</li></ul>



<h2>Do you complete him?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Do-you-complete-him.jpg" alt="Do you complete him?" class="wp-image-681"></figure>



<p>&nbsp;According to the bible woman were created to make a life on a man better.</p>



<p>If you see something wrong with your man and you don&rsquo;t care.<strong> You don&rsquo;t love him!</strong></p>



<p>Which is why it is a sin to sleep with a girl before marriage. A woman is with you to improve your life. So, as a man, you must respect that and make her your wife.</p>



<p>You must be thinking what this has to do with me saying yes to a relationship? A lot actually!</p>



<p>A guy will tell you why the last relationship didn&rsquo;t work. Will you make the same mistakes? Forget who was wrong in the prior. Understand what he is looking for this time.</p>



<p>If the prior relationship failed because her girlfriend cheated. You know you also have a problem with cheating. Then it is obvious you don&rsquo;t complete him, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like him.</p>



<p><strong>You are not in his life to make his life better, but worse!</strong></p>



<p>A man that had a problem with money spending and met someone who can help him. &ldquo;no baby this not how you use money, try this instead.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Even if they break up, he will always have a soft spot for her. Because she came with the change in his life.</p>



<p>You must always think is there anything I can do to complete this man.&nbsp; So that if any girl can come throwing her to him. He will see that girl as the trouble that is here to end his relationship, and he doesn&rsquo;t want that.</p>



<p>You can date a complete person, but somehow, they realize you bring no value to them and move on.</p>



<p>Man can stay for years with someone they don&rsquo;t love. If that girl completes him and pleasant thing along the way he realizes he can not live without her.&nbsp; Then you might hear him saying I never thought we would make it this far.</p>



<p>This means he was just fooling around and found value and stayed forever. Which is nice!</p>



<p>Therefore, man sometimes ends up marriage someone who was a housemaid. That maid brought more value than his girlfriend. Not that I encourage this, but it happens.</p>



<p>By me saying complete him. I don&rsquo;t mean cooking, washing, and buying things. Yes, all that can be nice. But even simple things like telling him to visit his mother. This alone can make him see you differently, especially if the previous girlfriends never told him to.</p>



<p>Some girls will sleep with a guy and make a request or ask for money, then go home.</p>



<p>They won&rsquo;t even ask &ldquo;baby you are working why don&rsquo;t you do 1 and 2? Because by doing this it can help you with this and this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>They make the relationship all about them. You don&rsquo;t call me anymore, you don&rsquo;t take me out, you don&rsquo;t give me money and more.</p>



<p><strong>But if you don&rsquo;t bring value, why expect one</strong>?</p>



<p>Listen to his story, take some time. Before you say yes, can you complete him? The relationship isn&rsquo;t a one-way street where a man must meet all your qualifications and you lay claim.</p>



<p>You both must work on something.</p>



<p>Any relationship can last six months to a year, but if it still growing after year, respect that relationship.</p>



<p>Be the right woman for the man you are falling for, not just because he meets your requirements.</p>



<p>Know why you are falling, don&rsquo;t think you will find answers after you start dating.</p>



<h2>HIV status</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HIV-status.jpg" alt="HIV status" class="wp-image-686"></figure>



<p>This is the second thing girls do wrong. They don&rsquo;t ask you about HIV status until it too late.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Most girl fears to ask a guy about his HIV status. &nbsp;But the truth is, asking alone won&rsquo;t help. He might not give an honest answer.</p>



<p>The best practice if you feel that you love him is to ask him to go with you. So, you can both get tested.</p>



<p>According to the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Story-AIDS-Experts-Questions/dp/1557989842">The Inside Story on AIDS: Experts Answer Your Questions</a>&rdquo;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/41R0K75XZHL._SX305_BO1204203200_.jpg" alt="the book &ldquo;The Inside Story on AIDS: Experts Answer Your Questions&rdquo;" class="wp-image-698"></figure></div>



<p>A person can be exposed to HIV and test negative. The book also makes it clear that you can have HIV and test negative.</p>



<p>How is this possible?&nbsp; If you have HIV, but your body hasn&rsquo;t started fighting it. Your body won&rsquo;t produce antibodies against HIV. Your immune system must discover the virus and produce the antibodies that will fight HIV.</p>



<p>Expect in this book say a person can test negative for 3 months to a year depending on your blood while he/she has HIV.</p>



<p>Now that we know that, what this has to do with you?&nbsp; Before you enter the relationship, asking if a guy has HIV won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>



<p>Because he might think he is negative and has papers to prove it. But we know you can test negative even when positive.</p>



<p>This applies not only to him, but to you too. You might think you are negative based on your last result, but maybe you are not.</p>



<p>Going for an HIV test together will help you both if you end up saying yes to relationship.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t do that and later you are both sick. Don&rsquo;t blame him, and he can&rsquo;t blame you. Just face the reality and talk about what you going to do now that you have it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>After doing all that it time for you to tell him I&rsquo;m ready for this relationship. Whatever you have been doing on your side, stop. Because I&rsquo;m your girlfriend now.</p>



<p>Talk about your likes and dislikes. I wish you a happy dating.</p>
