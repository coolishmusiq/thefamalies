										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most dating apps have the worst reviews, and it is not surprising. I have tried dating online myself and it was a waste of my time. Dating apps back in 5-10 years used to be great. They were not this popular. Thus, you might hear stories like I meet my wife or husband on a dating app. This can sound tempting. The online dating game has changed a lot over the years. It is risky and a waste of time. Let look at the major reasons most people are losing interest in online dating.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide1-3-1024x576.jpg" alt="Why people are losing interest in dating apps" class="wp-image-1030"/></figure>



<h2>Premium and gold members are a scam in dating apps</h2>



<p>Most online dating platforms will force you to get premium or gold membership. But the wrong thing about this. Even with a paid version, they still limit you. When you are sending too many inboxes with your premium or gold subscriptions. They will tell you have reached your daily limit. Which means you must pay more or wait 24 hours to send more.</p>



<p>If you don’t have premium and gold subscriptions, it is worse.</p>



<ul><li>They will hide who liked your profile</li><li>You won’t see who views your profile</li><li>Limit the number of profiles you can like</li><li>The number of inboxes you can send is not enough</li><li>Some won’t allow you to talk with gold or premium members. If you use a free version.</li></ul>



<h2>Scammers in online dating are real</h2>



<p>Scam in dating apps has raised a lot of questions. You get young players and the enormous ones. Common scams can include the following :</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Catfishing</strong>! This is when someone is pretending to be someone. Yet, using pictures they found on social media or<a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Google</a>. Therefore, you fell in love thinking you have found your match. Yet, you to find you are being played.</li><li><strong>Picture editing</strong>! We use a lot of editing software these days. Sometimes you meet someone online and they look super-hot. But when you meet them in person, you get disappointed.</li><li><strong>Money scams</strong>! Some will scam you small amounts. Like when someone says they will visit you. But they don’t have money for a bus fare. When you send a bus fare. They will block you right away. Others target rich people and they will stick around for a very long time. Maybe 6 to 12 months. Then make up stories and borrow serious cash. You fall for a trap and they disappear.</li><li><strong>Human trafficking</strong>! These are the most dangerous people in the online dating community. They also use fake accounts, fake pictures, and fake locations. You can’t tell someone is trafficking human. Until you meet them. Then no one will ever see you again. Which is sad. Yet it happens all the time.</li><li><strong>Junk ads</strong>! Most dating apps have shady ads and some have viruses. This can harm your phone or computer. If not, add you on subscriptions. That will steal your airtime every day. You might end up changing your sim card.</li><li><strong>Data breaches</strong>! They have accused some platforms of selling information from their clients. Some are not secured enough. Hackers can steal your personal information. Like numbers and emails to use them for personal reasons.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide3-1024x576.jpg" alt="dating apps are risky" class="wp-image-1032"/></figure>



<h2><strong>Dating apps can destroy your reputation</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>People who use these apps say it is embarrassing. It is hard to tell people you got someone online. If you see someone you know on a dating app. you can’t help it but wonder why are they using the dating apps. They also think the same of you. These apps are not for shy people like me.</p>



<p>Some use fake names and fake pictures. Not to scam people, but to hide from family and friend. After you have exchanged numbers. They reveal themselves to you. That if they like you.</p>



<p>You find people are in relationships or even married. But using these apps. which destroy their status, and the reputation of their spouse or whoever they are dating.</p>



<h2>Users are addicted to dating platforms.</h2>



<p>People go online to look for a partner and find one. But they never leave the dating apps. even when they found someone. They keep wanting more. Thinking they can get someone even better.</p>



<p>The most online relationship fails. They know they can always get more and more. The moment you break a promise or cannot show up. They are not interested in you anymore. Fixing problem is not the way they do things.</p>



<h3>They want hookups not genuine relationship</h3>



<p>If you are looking for a long-term relationship. Don’t waste your time with any dating app, try something else. Because they are looking for sex, not a proper relationship. If you think you will find someone who is loyal and committed. Don’t be surprised if it ends in tears.</p>



<p>You might get STD from a relationship which didn’t work.</p>



<p>The funny thing about this. You can meet someone online today and they only know 1 or 2 pictures of you. But within a few minutes, they want you to visit them. They don’t know your background. No clue about what you like and don’t like. Yet they are already talking about seeing each other. This is obvious they don’t care about you. It all about sex with them.</p>



<h2>Dating apps are not for unemployed people</h2>



<p>These apps have a lot of gold diggers in one place. Then any other online community. They can tell you are unemployed by looking at your pictures.</p>



<p>If they see you don’t have money. You won’t even get a reply. Some won’t even read your message. This why most get rejected on dating apps. you won’t have time to explain yourself. Once they visit your profile and see your picture. They judged you and there is nothing you can do.</p>



<p>If you want to survive, you must take your picture in high places. Your profile must interest enough.</p>



<p>If you are working, you must have a car. After you must take them out to pleasant restaurants. If you cannot afford these things. You might as well delete your app. 90% of them will reject you every day.</p>



<h2>You don’t need a dating app.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="stop wasting your time with online dating" class="wp-image-1031"/></figure>



<p>Most realize they don’t need dating apps. you can find love in the old fashion way. Learn how you can <strong><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/staying-happily-single-while-looking-for-someone/">stay happily single until you find someone</a>. </strong>You may also like, <strong><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/before-she-says-yes-to-a-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things every girl should do before she says yes in a relationship</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Love is everywhere, you need to be available. If you stay home all the time. You must go out more. If you still using dating platforms. You are looking for your match in the wrong place. Putting your life at risk and wasting your time.</p>



<p>Respect yourself and delete your dating profiles.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide1-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Staying happily single while looking for someone" class="wp-image-1017"/></figure>



<p>There is no way we can control. When the right person will come into our lives. But we can make ourselves visible for all the possibilities.</p>



<p>If you are looking for a partner. You must expand your life and be creative. Hopefully, on that journey, you will find a lover of your life.</p>



<p>Find things you can do and enjoy. But increasing your chances of finds a partner. Things you rarely do. Even though you have an interest in them.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to take an invitation from your friends. But avoid hanging out with the same people all the time. This will get boring. If you hang out with the same people you. It must be different locations at least.</p>



<p>It can be a challenge to go to places where you don’t know anyone. But that where new friendship and fun will come from.</p>



<p>Choices are unlimited you can try –</p>



<ul><li>Gym</li><li>Visit coffee shops</li><li>Travel to new places</li><li>Visit jazz clubs</li><li>Church and more</li></ul>



<h2>Take the lead in trying new things</h2>



<p>If no one is inviting you to try new things. Don’t sit and wait, invite them yourself.<br>Even if after all this you don’t find a partner. You will still make new friends and you will have a good time doing it. This is a win, win process.<br>Taking a lead will not always mean you have to invite friends to certain events. You can also volunteer for any job or service that you can enjoy.<br>Everyone can meet someone. We need to be active and date ready.</p>



<h2>Loving your self first before finding love</h2>



<ul><li>Take yourself out</li><li>Buy yourself pleasant things</li></ul>



<ul><li>Celebrate yourself and more.</li></ul>



<p>The more you celebrate and love yourself. More people will find you attractive. If you don’t love yourself how can you expect someone to love you?<br>Loving and taking care of yourself. Will give the first impression to most people you meet. This increases your chances of finding someone.<br>This makes you proud of who you are and you also get respect.</p>



<h2>The right and the wrong places to get a lover</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="PLACES YOU CAN TRY, SO YOU CAN FIND A PARTNER" class="wp-image-1018"/></figure>



<p>Let be realistic, not all the places. You go to and have fun will lead you to the right partner.<br>Think about people you can attract from each place. Because certain people attend certain places. Don’t forget about age.<br><strong>For example: &#8211; </strong>if you love music and you would love to meet someone with the same interest. Attending music conferences nearby can be a good place to start. You will attract people with the same interest. While learning.</p>



<h3>Common places to meet a partner while having fun</h3>



<ul><li>Soft club with low or no music. Where it not crowded and you can talk. Without being distracted by people and music.</li><li>The grocery store. Though there isn’t that much fun in grocery stores. You can get a brilliant partner while shopping. Dress up look nice and clean. Don’t but everything same day. Visiting different stores can increase your chances. Pick stores wisely shopping in town and buying in malls is not the same.</li><li>Visit art galleries nearby can also be a great experience.</li><li>National gardens are wonderful too. Most people go there to clear their heads and available to have some talk.</li></ul>



<p>Look at yourself and understand your needs. Because there is a lot to do out there for different people.</p>



<h3>Terrible places for meeting partners</h3>



<p>Some places can be good for fun. But not for <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/before-she-says-yes-to-a-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding a partner</a>.</p>



<ul><li>Places like stadiums during soccer games can be fun. But it loud and hard to have a decent conversation. Very few can pay attention to you. Everyone is talking and focusing on a soccer match.</li><li>Night clubs, some say they can be a good place to meet friends. I disagree with them. They can be risky and might attract criminals. People who are attending clubs. These are the people who rarely do well with commitment and loyalty. You can get lucky, but it not worth your time.</li><li>Libraries will also waste your time. No one is interested in talking to anyone. They are there for studies. Some will even have a sign of no talking.</li></ul>



<p>You still need to use your judgment and find what best for you.</p>



<h2>Lower your dating expectations</h2>



<p>I understand the entire purpose to put yourself out there is to meet someone. But lower your expectations because we don’t know. If you will find your partner this week, next month, or in a year.<br>If you have high expectations and you don’t find a partner soon. This can make you give up too early. It is about timing.<br>Put yourself out there and trust in God. Don’t forget to keep it safe and protect yourself from <a href="https://sacoronavirus.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>. Have fun God will do the rest.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide1-1.jpg" alt="Should you make your kids apologize?" class="wp-image-1000"/></figure></div>



<p>It a great practice to teach our kids to apologize. When our kids say I’m sorry they should mean it. We shouldn’t force our kids to apologize for the things they are not sorry for. But we must teach them to apologize and teach them not to over apologies.</p>



<p>Before we talk much about this one thing to remember. How your kids behave also affects your reputation. If your kids provoke people and don’t feel sorry for their actions. This says a lot about you as a parent.</p>



<p>Kids don’t like to be wrong and when they are wrong. They don’t like to admit they are wrong. If they must apologize, they try to fight it first or blame the other person. There is a lot to learn about <strong><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apologizing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the power of the apology</a><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apologizing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">.</a></strong></p>



<p>Forcing kids to say I’m sorry. You can increase anger and shame. This also makes them say sorry all the time without meaning it or changing their behavior.</p>



<h2>When to apologizing for your kids ‘</h2>



<p>Though I don’t enjoy apologizing for my kids. Sometimes kids can leave us with no choice. Especially if the problem involves someone older than your child. Also, when your child broke something and it needs to be paid for.</p>



<p>This will force you to act and take a responsibility for your child. Then later you can deal with your child. But there is no need to fight with your child. You must help them understand why what they did was wrong. Help them understand why they owe you an apology for fixing their problem. Your child must also promise it won’t happen again.</p>



<h2>When your child refuses to apologize</h2>



<p>You must always ask what happened first before telling your child to say I’m sorry. Get both sides of the story. Because sometimes the wrong kid can cry 1st. then a parent will tell the one that is not crying to apologize.</p>



<p>This can make the child refuse to apologize. Force a child to say I’m sorry will never be a good idea.</p>



<p>Even when your child refuses to apologize. You must not yale or get angry. The aim is to teach our kids to respect others. We also need to respect our kids and understand learning to apologize is a long process.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/what-are-the-worst-mistakes-parents-can-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The mistake parents do</a> </strong>is to forget kids are growing. Yelling will make your kids fear you. Once your kids fear you it gets even harder to teach them. Sometimes it damages them mentally.</p>



<p>If your child is still angry and refusing to apologize. Give them time to cool down and speak with them.</p>



<p>Apologizing is difficult, and it is hard to even for most adults. Most of them were not thought to apologize the right way growing up.</p>



<h2>Tips that can teach your kids to apologize</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2.jpg" alt="Tips that can teach your kids to apologize" class="wp-image-1001"/></figure></div>



<p>It is simple to apologize to your kids and those around you. When kids see you doing good, they will do the same.</p>



<p>Don’t force your kids to say I’m sorry. But help them understand how important it is to be sorry.</p>



<p>So that when they apologize it genuine and meaningful. This will also help them apologize, even when you are not around them.</p>



<h2>What is a humble apology?</h2>



<p>Our kids must understand apologizing doesn’t mean you are wrong. But you value your relationship with that person. Thus, they must be humble when they apologize. Because apologizing is not about them. It is about improving their friendship. The genuine apology will increase trust and authority.</p>



<p>Apologizing humble mean, you are truly sorry and you will do all that you could to make sure this won’t happen again.</p>



<h2>Why must kids learn to apologize?</h2>



<p>We need to teach our kids to apologize so they can protect their relationships with others.</p>



<p>The pleasant thing about kids learns to apologize at an early stage. They will use the same principles when they reach adult Hud.</p>



<p>Teaching kids to be sorry. Also, help them understand we all make mistakes. But we must take responsibility for our mistakes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mothers deserve better. Where it is a stepmother or bio mom. They both deserve better. But somehow most mothers’ days don’t always go the way you might hope for. Even as a stepmother you deserve to be treated specially on Mother’s Day. Because even though you are a stepmother, you still love your partner’s kids. You also do sacrifices for them. They need to show you they appreciate all this. Even though you are not the real mother.</p>



<h2>Lower your exceptions on a Mother’s Day</h2>



<p>The first step in avoiding Mother’s Day disappointment is to lower your expectations. Especially if you are a stepmother. Even if you know you sacrifice a lot for kids. You must lower your expectation. A lot can go wrong. Mother’s Day can make your The Stepkids miss their bio mom. While you on the other side expect them to show you love during this time.</p>



<p>I understand things we see on TV, Radio, Social Media, Etc. can make us jealous and feel like our kids don’t love you or appreciate you. Always keep in mind that every situation is different. Kids are different and parents. Some kids are still developing and some are fully grown. Some kids love you. But don’t know how to express their love to you yet. We all process things differently. Even us as a parent sometimes doesn’t express love the way we should.</p>



<p>My mother passed away when I was young, and my grandmother raised me. Even though my father was still present. My grandmother was the one taking care of me. Everything I needed, my father would pass money on to my grandmother. But she was the one who gets things done. Sometimes she didn’t even tell my dad. She would buy whatever I need with her mother. Yet, there was never a day on Mother’s Day. Where I did something for her to show that I appreciate her sacrifices. Am I proud of that? No, I did not understand she was special until I was grown. You must forget what happening around you. Focus on your situation.</p>



<h2>What role can father play on Mother’s Day?</h2>



<p>If you are a father, you must also play your part. She is raising your kids. You appreciate that. If your kids are not planning anything. It must be your job to ask them. <strong>“what should we do for your mother this Mother’s Day?” </strong>help your kids see the need to do something special for their mother. You can even help your kids with the present. Also, fund them if needed. But if they are working, that even better. Normalize showing your wife or girlfriend how special they are always.</p>



<h2>Celebrate yourself as a mother.</h2>



<p>It nice to be celebrated. There is that amazing feeling if someone shows you, they love you. But you must teach yourself to celebrate you before anyone else. If it is Mother’s Day and you know the important role you play in your kids’ life. You know you are a splendid mother and you are proud.<br>Celebrate yourself and be proud these kids have gone this far because of you. Don’t expect too much on others to go out there and celebrate you as a mother.</p>



<h2>Appreciate everything you get in a Mother’s Day</h2>



<p>Don’t be a picky mom. Learn to appreciate everything you get where it big or small. Be thankful because it the thought that counts. Even those small gifts come from a good heart. You might get the bigger present the following new, who knows?</p>

<p>Talking about your problems will not only help you in a healing process. This all builds a strong and lasting relationship. Create a strong connection in your relationship. You must never be in denial and avoid your issues. Problems will always be there; you need a good problem-solving skill. So, your relationship can always stay healthy.</p>



<p>Big warning though avoids making a big deal out of the small thing. Because I am saying you need to address things that bother you.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean everything, something you can forgive your partner. Without even talking about them, but if it keeps eating you inside. Then you can address it. Learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/making-a-big-deal-out-of-the-small-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>making a big deal out of small things</strong>.</a></p>



<p>If something happened in your relationship. You need to know how did this impact you emotionally and physically. Did it also affect your partner or it you? If your partner is not addressing the issue. This doesn’t mean they are not hurting. Especially men like to be powerful people. That why most of the time they like to keep feelings to themselves. Then it keeps adding and adding until they can’t take anymore.</p>



<p>Men can wake up one day and tell you I don’t want this anymore. You won’t understand what happened. But it several things he did not address.</p>



<p>If you talk to your partner, they learn to open to you. Because your partner might hurt secretly. Even if he is hurting or you are hurting secretly. That anger will show itself one day. You might not even realize it connected to the previous unaddressed issues.</p>



<h2><strong>Old issues</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Your relationship will not grow until you learn to talk. Avoid creating distance in your relationship. If your partner brings up an old issue that has been bothering him or her. You must never ask them why they want to talk about it now. Because until you address it. It will keep affecting the relationship.</p>



<p>You must take this as the opportunity to fix the previous issue. Stop wondering why now, fix it and move on. Because if your partner brought something up. This means there is more they want you to understand.</p>



<p>Yes, you won’t be able to fix all your issues. But talking about them will make your partner see you care, and you are listening. So, talking can heal your partner even when there was no solution. Being heard alone means more. Because your partner now knows if this happens again you will know how to act.</p>



<p>Stop leaving issue undressed. It will never be good for your relationship.</p>

<p>Even though family fights are useless, they happen. Happy families avoid this, and your family should avoid fights. We expect them where people of varying age live together so closely and must share so many things in common.</p>



<ul><li>Ruffled feelings</li><li>sharp words</li><li>sudden outbursts</li></ul>



<p>We should forget such storms in your family. They must not be allowed to leave any hint of unfriendly will. Sometimes we take family fusses too seriously, the issue over them, and allow them to darken the family’s happiness.</p>



<p>A home must be a place where people bond together with their children, a place where parents love one another, place where the immature are protected and guarded, a place where one can rest and have privacy, and more.</p>



<p>Not a place where family member fight all the time.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-exes.jpg" alt="Everything you need to know about exes" class="wp-image-877"/></figure>



<p>Once you become an Ex, a lot of drama and confusion is involved. Should you block him? Should you continue supporting him? If I do what this means?</p>



<p>Today I’m going to help you deal with your ex the right way. Also, answer the question like. How do you know when it over? Do you still love your ex or you are just lonely?</p>



<p>There are many reasons you think about your ex.  You might miss those late-night talk and if you haven’t found a new partner. You will miss your ex the most. Thinking about your ex doesn’t mean you must get back together. Sometimes you must move on. Because <strong>going back might hurt you even more.</strong></p>



<p>Accepting the relationship is over can be hard and the longer it takes, the harder it gets. After getting a new partner, it gets better. The thoughts of your ex will never be permanently forgotten. However, you will feel better after a few years. It like the death of someone we love. It gets hard, at the 1<sup>st</sup> until we learn to leave without them.</p>



<p>If you think about your ex. Yet you don’t think they deserve a second chance. It helps to spend more time with family and friends. Until you find someone.</p>



<p>Failing to find a new relationship will make you think about your ex even more. Don’t be stuck in your past, because it would be all you see. You can still find someone new. That will value and respect you.</p>



<p>There is a reason your last relationship ended. Don’t forget about those reasons. History always repeats itself, if we keep going back to your past.</p>



<p>If we are in a relationship, we follow certain patterns. Sometimes we miss things we did with our exes, not necessarily them.  If you are lucky to find someone new, who will teach you new patterns. That when we forget the old ones. </p>



<p>Missing your ex means you are lonely, and you haven’t found a new life. Which will close the gap for your old life.</p>



<p>It is hard to understand. If you miss your ex or just having someone to spend quality time with. Or you just miss sex.</p>



<p>However, it also possible you are still in love with your ex. If you made a quick decision without thinking it through. Sometimes we end relationships just to avoid solving problems.</p>



<p>If that the case, your mind knows you ended the relationship without good reasoning. Your relationship can still work, you just need to put pride aside and solve your problems.</p>



<p>But there must never be a day when you try so hard to get your ex back. Doing this will give your ex more power and they might take you for granted. Even when you are truly in love with your ex. Wait until they prove they still have the attention in a relationship.</p>



<h2>What do you do if you still like your ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/still-like-your-ex.jpg" alt="still like your ex" class="wp-image-881"/></figure>



<p>Some relationships can end while you are still in love. If this happens, it can be hard to move on. Not because you cannot move on. You don’t want to move on. Maybe you still wish your ex can come back and apologize.</p>



<p>This can make you feel stuck in your past relationship. The worse thing that can happen, your ex might never apologize. If you still love you ex, yet no chance of a rebound. You must first accept it over. If you don’t accept it ended. You won’t think about what to do next.</p>



<p>You will keep thinking about what if you did things differently. Maybe the outcome would be different. Which is true, but you didn’t accept it. It takes two people to be in a relationship. If one is no longer be part of it, then it no longer a relationship.</p>



<p>The only time I can advise you to go after your ex, is when your ex haven’t moved on too. They are not involved in a new relationship and they are still in contact you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But going after your ex when they have moved on. Can put you in a very painful position. You can also talk to your friends and family members. People who knew your relationship very well. Ask for advice on what to do. If they know the relationship is not good for you, they will tell you.</p>



<p>Loving yourself and opening up to a new life. Will help you move your focus away from your ex. Make your breakup the opportunity to do new things. You couldn’t do it in a relationship.</p>



<p>When the breakup is still new. You will think about all the bad things about your ex. When time goes by you think about the wonderful memories. That when you will miss your ex the more. But just because you are thinking about the good times. Doesn’t mean your partner is good for you.</p>



<p>Going back to your ex just because you have the old wonderful memories. Does not mean all those good things will happen again if you get back together.</p>



<h2>Why do exes contact you out of the blue?</h2>



<p>Should I call back my ex? Your ex can contact you for different reasons. The best way to understand is to talk to them. Even though you can ignore him/her. Maybe you want peace in your life.</p>



<p>Some exes are lonely and want to have a conversation. Sometimes when they go through a hard time. They want support from you. Especially if they haven’t found a new partner to replace you.</p>



<p>It is totally up to you to answer or call back your ex. If you still have feeling and the reason for a breakup are not that bad. Why not! But if you feel they don’t deserve your time, then don’t give them attention.</p>



<h2>Does dreaming of an ex mean they miss you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dreaming-of-your.jpg" alt="dreaming of your ex" class="wp-image-876"/></figure>



<p>Dreaming about your ex will make you question yourself. Do I still love my ex? If you have a new relationship. It will feel you are betraying your new partner. </p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex can mean two things. You miss your ex or your ex misses you. Most cases if you thought about your ex before you went to sleep. There is a high chance you might dream of your ex that night.</p>



<p>If your ex thinks or talks about you. The universe can hear that and talk to you back with a dream.  This is why we dream about most recent events more often.</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex giving you advice. Your mind is telling not to repeat same mistakes you did with your ex. </p>



<p>Dreaming of your ex death doesn’t mean your ex is dying. But your feelings for the old relationship are dying.    </p>



<h2>Can exes fall back in love?</h2>



<p>Yes, your ex can fall back in love with you and it happens more than you might think.</p>



<p>If they lost no dignity in your breakup. It is still possible to get back together and still possible your ex misses you too.</p>



<p>This will also depend on the age of your relationship. If you and your ex have a lot of history together. It won’t be easy to move on for any of you.</p>



<p>But <strong>your relationship ended for a reason don’t forget</strong>. If your relationship with your ex was in an excellent position or healthy. It wouldn’t have ended in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Before you make your ex fall back in love. You must think of every problem you were having in your relationship. Think if they can be solvable or not. If your relationship had serious problems like <strong>cheating and abuse</strong>. Forget about that relationship, <strong>just forget</strong>.</p>



<p>But if your ex was bringing value in your life. Yet, you didn’t realize how much your ex was helping you. Now that your relationship is over. Your life is not complete anymore.</p>



<p>Think of everything you did which made you ex to fall out. Fix your self 1<sup>st</sup> before you go back to apologize. The only way to make your ex fall back. Will begin by you admitting all your mistakes and making sure you don’t repeat them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exes often come back but don’t wait for your ex. They might not come back.</p>



<h2>How do you know if an ex misses you?</h2>



<p>How do you know if your ex secretly misses you? Most of us will use a breakup as a time to heal. Once we heal, we may miss our old relationship.</p>



<p>But even when we miss our exes, sometimes pride can kick in. We wait for them to miss us too.</p>



<h3>If one of these things happens. Then your ex could be missing you.</h3>



<ul><li>If your ex blocked you on a breakup and recently unblocked you.</li><li>If your ex finds random excuses to contact you.</li><li>Start asking about you in your friends and family.</li><li>Call you or text you when they are drunk.</li><li>Start stalking you on social media.</li><li>Your ex is always happy to see you.</li><li>Remembers your birthdays.</li><li>Give your kids some money.</li></ul>



<p>These can be clues that your ex is missing you. But do you miss your ex? Your ex can miss you, yet if you have moved on. Don’t go back.</p>



<h2>Do exes come back after months?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/exes-ccome-back-after-months.jpg" alt="exes ccome back after months" class="wp-image-878"/></figure>



<p>Most of the time they will. Removing someone in your mind is difficult. Some forget after a few months, for some, it gets harder.  Sometimes we have 0 control of our memories.</p>



<p>Most of the time your ex will come back after seeing you dating someone else. Seeing you with someone else can make your ex jealous.  If you are in a new relationship. They feel like someone is winning something that belongs to them.</p>



<p>But if your ex date someone else quickly after a breakup. They might not come back. The only time they will come back is when. This new relationship they started is not what they hoped for.</p>



<p>If they also celebrated the breakup publicly. Even when they miss you, the chances of them coming back are too small.</p>



<p>Sometimes your ex will get back to you, just to prove a point. Or if you used to support your ex. They might miss you when they face tough times.</p>



<p>If your ex comes back after months. It can be a good thing or he/she is coming back with more problems.</p>



<h2>Should you keep supporting your ex?</h2>



<p>Stop supporting your ex after a breakup. Just stop! If you are no longer in a relationship. That person is no longer your responsibility.</p>



<p>Whether you support your ex emotional or financial. It is not your place to do that. Let your ex go, <strong>either they are with you or they are not.</strong></p>



<p>Stop trying to make yourself look important. You are just forcing yourself in a place you don’t belong to.</p>



<p>Even if your ex is the one coming back for support. Keep in mind, they deserve nothing. They left you!</p>



<h2>Does silence make an ex miss you?</h2>



<p>Silence can make a man miss you. But not all men!</p>



<p>Silence can also make a man move on, from his past relationship.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, silence can work but there are no guarantees. <strong>A lot can happen while you are silent</strong>. You also have no right to blame him, since you went silent.</p>



<p>But it always a good idea to lay low sometimes. This helps you avoid saying things you don’t mean. Just go silent make your ex wonder why you don’t give them attention anymore. Have you found someone or you really don’t have a feeling for them anymore?</p>



<p>Silence will make your exes realize your absence and start missing. But this can also trigger him to look for a new partner. Since your exes are now feeling lonely.</p>



<p>You can cut a guy off and let him miss you. Don’t give him too much space though if you still love him. Because he will develop new patterns without you.</p>



<p>If you want to stop talking to your ex. So, your ex can miss you, know it does not end there. You still need to do more to make sure your plan works. Try this</p>



<ul><li>Keep in contact with your ex family members. Even though you don’t talk to your ex.</li><li>Don’t block your ex on social media. Make your ex see everything you are up too.</li><li>Invest in yourself, go out, and have fun.</li></ul>



<p>These can help if you want your ex to miss you. Yet you don’t want to talk to him yet. </p>



<h2>Can you stay a friend with an ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/staying-friends-with-an-ex.jpg" alt="staying friends with an ex" class="wp-image-880"/></figure>



<p>People ask this question a lot. The reason they want to stay friends with their ex. They still care about them and enjoy their company.</p>



<p>If you also feel this way, I have a question for you. <strong>If you still enjoy each other’s company, why did you break up?</strong></p>



<p>Why didn’t you both fix your problem instead of breaking up?</p>



<p>Because if you breakup with someone. It means you want nothing to do with them. But this is not a simple question to answer. I think it can really depend on you and what you want.</p>



<p>Someone who cheated on you, can not expect you to be friends with them after a breakup. However, if the breakup was just a small miss understanding. It&#8217;s understandable to remain friends. It still depends on how big are your problems and can they be fixed.</p>



<p>But if you or your ex have new partners. Staying friends is a no go!</p>



<p>Since the relationship end for a reason. Staying a friend with your ex can also take away your time to heal. It is also a disrespect to your new relationship.</p>



<h2>Why do guys act like they don&#8217;t care after a breakup?</h2>



<p><strong>Sometimes they are not acting, they really don’t care</strong>. If you care about someone you do everything to keep them. If you still act like you don’t care about a breakup. Then you didn’t deserve that relationship in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Stop following your ex if you see they don’t care after a breakup. Move back and force on you.</p>



<p>Once someone becomes your ex, they need not explain themselves to you. Because you are no longer together. <strong>That why they say what yours will always come to you.</strong></p>



<p>If your ex doesn’t come back after a breakup. The relationship was never yours. Move on, you will find someone new. There is no person who is better than everyone. You can always find someone who is better than your ex. Don’t be stuck with people who treat you like you mean nothing to them.</p>



<h2>Reason to take a break after a breakup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/healing-after-a-breakup.jpg" alt="healing after a breakup" class="wp-image-879"/></figure>



<p>There are many reasons you should heal. After a failed relationship. Many of us jump into the next relationship. With hope, it will heal the past relationship. However, in most cases, it doesn’t. taking a break can be good for your mental health.</p>



<p>Jumping to the next relationship can replace pain with happiness. But it won’t heal you, once your new relationship slows down. You will feel more pain. You might even regret your decision. Going back is no longer a wise choice.</p>



<p>If your new relationship fails. You are now facing pain for two relationship. Which both didn’t work.</p>



<p>Not allowing yourself to heal can create a lot of problems. <strong>Like trust issues, anger, insecurities, etc</strong>.</p>



<p>Moving on without healing can negatively affect your emotions and the way you think.</p>



<p>Breakups can be a trauma no matter what side you are on.</p>



<h3>Recovering after a breakup</h3>



<p>Some break up can be bad. But you need to pick yourself up and move on. Your life doesn’t end in a breakup, there is still a lot you can accomplish.</p>



<p>Recovering also mean you finding the right partner the next time. Not repeating the same patterns of bad partners.</p>



<ul><li>In the first step, focus on helping yourself. Getting professional help if you feel your need one, talking to your family members. Talking to your friends asking them what to do in your situation. Reaching out to people who recently recovered from relationship fail, and more. You know who are your good friends and best family members are. Because not everyone knows you and understands you.</li><li>Teach yourself that it is okay to feel pain after a breakup. The pain is not permanent, and it is not the end of your world. You are in control and you have the power to take yourself out of that pain.</li><li>Take some time and point out what did you do wrong. So, you can start learning from your mistakes and avoid them as early as possible in your next relationship. Learn what made you pick this person and what was good about him. What was bad about him or what was bad about you both in your past relationship? Makes sure you get all the fact right before you start a new relationship. I cannot guarantee your next relationship will work out. But you will avoid most problems from your previous relationship.</li><li>Don’t contact each other unless there are kids involved. But if you don’t have kids with your ex. There is no need to follow your ex on social media or keeping in touch. Because you will be starting noticing things your ex is doing right. Which can make you fall in love and forget why you guy broke up in the first place. </li><li>The experiment has fun and put yourself out there. Try new things, try a new life. Make yourself available not only to a new partner. But new friends also. Everything new can be exciting, which can help you heal faster. The more you try new things, the faster you will move away from your past.</li><li>Regain confidence and trust in yourself. Just believe you can gain anything that you want. You need not settle for less and keep going back to people who hurt you. Trust yourself you can move on and get everything that you want. It is a process but when you know what you want. Eventual it will come to you.</li><li>Maintain your dignity after a breakup. Don’t be a person who keeps begging for a relationship. No need to always try to fix your relationship. Especially if you see your partner don’t care anymore. If someone makes up their decision that they no longer want to be in a relationship with you. Stop fighting it and accept their decision. Begging to make you look desperate, which makes your partner lose attraction even more. You are going to be okay regardless of what is happening in your life. </li></ul>



<h2>How do you tell she&#8217;s not over her ex?</h2>



<p>Dating someone who is not over his ex is painful. But how can you tell if your new girlfriend is not over her ex?</p>



<h3>These can be signs she is not over her ex.</h3>



<ul><li>She keeps making excuses to visit you.</li><li>She talks about her past relationship a lot.</li><li>She still keeps in contact with her ex.</li><li>She gets angry at you for no reason.</li><li>Never enjoy sex with you.</li><li>Always treating you, she will leave the relationship.</li><li>She doesn’t want to meet your family.</li></ul>



<h2>Should you take back an ex who dumped you?</h2>



<p>If you still love them you can, but if you have moved on don’t.</p>



<p>Because this means whatever they thought they were doing didn’t work. Now they are coming back to you as a backup plane.</p>



<p>You need someone who will be full committed to you.</p>



<p>Not someone who will come and go when it suits him/her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Who hurts more after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Women are more sensitive than man. They also sacrifice a lot in a relationship then most men. They even sacrifice their family just to be with you.</p>



<p>Very few men can move out of their home just to be with a woman.</p>



<p>If a woman enters a relationship. They enter with everything they have.</p>



<p>If the relationship doesn’t work, it is safe to say. Women will hurt the most.</p>



<h2>Who moves on faster after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Man can move on before a breakup. By the time the relationship gets in to a break up they are long gone. Sometimes by the time they end the relationship. They are already involved a new one.</p>



<p>While women on the other hand. Needs some time to heal after a break. It can take them a very long time to heal.&nbsp; Sometimes it even takes years for a woman to move on.</p>



<p>The only time man will have a hard time moving on after a breakup. Will only be a time where he fails to find a better partner. Which will replace the old one.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, even though men move on faster. This does not mean they don’t miss you, or they are not hurting over the past relationship. They do but they don’t allow the pain to control them.</p>



<h2>Why people get stuck after breakup?</h2>



<p>People sometime get stuck with they ex. Even though they know the relationship was not good for them.</p>



<h3>These can be the reasons they are stuck.</h3>



<ul><li>They get in denial, they know relationship was not good for them. Yet they keep think it can be fixed. But they failed to fix it.</li><li>Thinking their happiness belong to their ex-partner. That without their ex, they can’t have a good time.</li><li>Hold on to the old promises.</li><li>Focusing too much on the great time they both shared. Not willing to try new things.</li><li>Busy asking themselves why me, instead of asking. What did I learn from this?</li><li>Comparing their life to someone else’s life.</li><li>Staying in contact with their ex.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Most of my advice are based on my past experience. However, how you treat your ex is total up to you.</p>



<p>But if your keep making the wrong decisions there will be consequence. Those results can make you hurt repeatedly.</p>



<p>If you find yourself hurting by a same person repeatedly. This means you must look back into your decisions. Try to understand what role are you playing. How can you get yourself out?</p>



<p>Don’t allow more pain in your life. If it doesn’t work, try new things that works. Stop trying things that can’t be fixed and love yourself. Because you deserve all the good things like everyone else.    </p>

<p>The mistake we do as parents is to think we can be perfect parent. When there is no such thing as perfect parenting. Because you are older, doesn’t mean you are always right. Some days you will say wrong things to your kids or be hash. Nothing wrong with going back to your kids and apologize.  You must never have the pride to apologise. Not only with your kids, but in life. </p>



<p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apologizing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to apologise and when.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Slide1-1024x576.jpg" alt="parents worst mistakes" class="wp-image-863"/></figure>



<p>Every parent makes mistakes, and every kid makes mistakes. You will make mistakes there is no way to prevent them. You can only reduce and cut your mistakes. But you can’t prevent them.</p>



<p>Beliefs we have can make us parent the wrong way. We must be open to learning new things and changed as the world change. Trying to raise your kids the same way you grew up won’t work. If your parents punished you a lot as a kid. Which made a powerful man. Don’t think it is wise to raise your kids that way. Beliefs are what will make us do most mistakes.</p>



<p>If you have a certain style of parenting and you see it not working. Do not force it, learn something else. Notice everything that is not working. Drop your ego, understand there is so much you don’t know.</p>



<p>let look at what are the worst mistakes parents can make.</p>



<h2>Not choosing your words wisely.</h2>



<p>Words are powerful, and they can build or destroy. You must be careful about what you say to your children. My mom passed away when I was very young, and there are things my stepmother said to me. When I was 9 years old, about my bio mother. Which I carry to this day. Because they were mean things to say to a child. </p>



<p>Words as parents sometimes can come out the wrong way. Words have a deep meaning. They can heal and be weapons.</p>



<h2>Talking too much with your kids.</h2>



<p>Avoid talking too much with your kids. Say things you want to say and give them time to process everything. If you spend 30 minutes talking to your kids. They won’t remember everything, only the thing which makes sense to them. You don’t have to say the same things over and over for kids to understand you. If you do that it feels like abuse they heard the 1<sup>st</sup> time. Yet you still repeating it over and over.</p>



<p><strong>.Less is more!</strong> The worst mistakes parents make when talking to kids. Not paying attention to a kid&#8217;s needs.  </p>



<h2>Not realizing how expensive babies can be.</h2>



<p>You are going to be the one carrying for your baby. Know your financial status and understand if you are ready. If you have over one kid. They can get too expensive and if you have no plan. You will experience problems. You might even be angry at kids for destroying your budget. While it is you who had no birth plan.</p>



<p>With babies, we don’t know exactly when are they coming. But we need to save as early as possible. So, when that day comes, we are ready. It is difficult to save after you have a baby. It much easier if you save before you have a child.</p>



<h2>Neglecting kids&#8217; hunger</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="hunger" class="wp-image-864"/></figure>



<p>You can’t expect your kids to be at their best while their tummy is empty. Hunger makes it hard to concentrate and can escalate misbehaving. Even us as parents we are likely to be impatient when we are hungry.  Parents sometimes force kids to go out and play with other kids. Therefore, they can avoid making food for them. If you do that stop it now, it is not good for your child.</p>



<p>It your job to make sure your kids eat at all times. If their appetite drop take that seriously. </p>



<h2>Giving  your kids Alcohol</h2>



<p>Parents have a tendency of making kids taste alcohol. When a child start acts odd. they think it hilarious and take videos to post on social media. The following tweet is the great example of bad parenting. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have watched this 35 times <a href="https://t.co/QNusyBCYG0">pic.twitter.com/QNusyBCYG0</a></p>&mdash; Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) <a href="https://twitter.com/RupertMyers/status/1315998224193331200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>You must choose your kids over alcohol. If you allow your kids to taste alcohol. You are the worst parent and they must arrest you. The drinking age is 18 years old here in South Africa, and in some parts of the world, it is 21 years old. There is a reason for this. </p>



<p>I see this a lot, even in my family. I never understand. How can you do such a thing to your child? What lessons are you giving them? I just don’t get it! </p>



<p>There is a lot you can do with your kids. Things like <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/helping-your-children-learn-to-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping them learn to share</a>. Instead of giving them alcohol.</p>



<h2>Shouting at your kids</h2>



<p>You must avoid freaking out for your kids. Shouting undermines your ability to get your words through. They either shut down or get mad in response to your shouting. Shouting at your kids also makes them feel you hate them. They also feel like the worst kids and hate themselves. <strong>Avoid shouting!</strong></p>



<p>Try to talk some sense with them without rising your voice. </p>



<h2>Blocking your kids from technology</h2>



<p>There is a debate about smartphones and laptops. Parents have a fear of buying smartphones for their children. They might play games all the time and stop doing school work. Or watch unsuitable content for their age and more. <strong>This is all true!</strong></p>



<p>But let stop focusing on what can go wrong. Think about what technology can bring to your child. How I usually do this, when I’m thinking about buying a smartphone for my child. Yet, I’m worried they might use it the wrong way.</p>



<p>First, I buy a new phone and give a child the old one. When I give my child the old one, I never tell them it theirs. “This is my old phone, you can use it. Because I have a new one. But if I see this phone is making you lose focus on important things like school. I will take it away.”</p>



<p>While I know the phone is no longer mine. Yet I don’t let the kid know that. So, they can give it some respect.</p>



<p>Same thing with laptops. I never give them 100% ownership. But the worst thing you can do is to block your children from using technology. I try to teach my kids everything that can help them be independent. Like how to invest in the stock market. Blogging and everything that they can start as a hobby. But in a log run generate good income.  Would it be nice to see your kids making their 1st $1000 at 16? Wouldn’t that be great?</p>



<h2>Shaming your kids</h2>



<p>Shaming kids is another worst mistake parent do. If your child did something wrong. There is no need to compare your child with the one that is doing great. By doing this, and it will make your kids hate one another. Because you make them think. The other one is bad, and the other is the best. Parents also expect kids to do things the way their parents taught them. If they fail, then they see them as losers. <strong>Stop shaming your kids, it is wrong. </strong>Give them time to make mistakes and learn their own mistake.</p>



<p>The following video help us with ways we unknowingly shame our children.</p>



<iframe width="660" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R7B0Wi-kImg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<h2>Parents fighting with kids</h2>



<p>We see this almost everywhere. When after parents broke up, they fighting using kids. Kids have nothing to do with our breakups. Kids deserve both parents, even when those parents are no longer together. A child must have a relationship with both parents.</p>



<p>I experienced this a lot with my 1<sup>st</sup> child’s mother. She would try to get back to me and if that didn’t work out. She would cut me out completely, to a point where it would be impossible to contact both. That was painful to me, and I’m sure it was for my daughter.</p>



<p>Parents need to stop involving kids in their personal problems. <strong>Love your children more than you dislike each other.</strong></p>



<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake to not be the part of your child growing up.</p>



<h2>Be a leading example to your kids</h2>



<p>I think I have talked about this before in one of my posts. How kids can be copycats. You need to be a leading example in everything you want them to be. If you want them to treat everyone with respect. You must be the one treating your family with respect first. Kids learn more when they watch you doing something. Then when they listen to you talking about it. </p>



<p>If you want more kindness in the world, put some there.</p>



<h2>Not teaching your kids boundaries</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Slide3-1024x576.jpg" alt="kids boundaries" class="wp-image-865"/></figure>



<p>Families must have boundaries and kids too. You must train children to do a certain thing and to act in certain ways. Example, your kids must knock every time they enter your bedroom. If you don’t teach them this as early as possible. One day they will see things you don’t want them to see and they will humble you.</p>



<p>Setting restrictions teach our kids to respect and know their limits.</p>



<h2>Never be your child&#8217;s best friend</h2>



<p>Kids need to understand you are not a friend. But a parent, if they have problems. They must come to you. If you have problems, you won’t come to them, but their father. It is very rare that you will tell them your secrets. However, it is not okay for them to keep a secret from you. They are not allowed to use your things without your person.</p>



<p>Long story short, we can be close. But not too close to a point where there are no boundaries.</p>



<h2>Expecting your child to fulfill your dreams</h2>



<p>We all have things we wanted to do growing up. Which we didn’t, no need to force our kids to do things we failed to do ourselves. You can try to teach them if you feel is important and can help them. However, if you see, they are not into it. Don’t force them, let them pick their own system of life.</p>

<p>Talk about family problems you can expect in any marriage. Every family has problems and we can never run away from it. If you believe your family won’t have problems. You are just setting yourself for a disaster. Because you won’t know how to act. When you reach that point in life.</p>



<p>If your family doesn’t have problems it because you are the problem and they haven’t told you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/marriage-is-not-easy-1024x576.jpg" alt="marriage is not easy" class="wp-image-856"/></figure>



<ul><li>Either you are going to be a problem</li><li>You are going to marry a problem</li><li>Either you are going to marry a family with problems</li><li>Or you will have problems entering your marriage from the outside</li><li>Either your family is the problem&nbsp;</li><li>Or the combination of them all</li></ul>



<p>“Marriage will show you how selfish you are, and parenting will show you how angry you are.” That true and common in marriages.</p>



<p>Children are growing and still have lots of mistakes to make. Parents want them to act right all the time.</p>



<p>The wife is raised by a different family and the husband. There are days where they won’t see eye to eye. Some days one will be selfish and the other will have pride.</p>



<p>If pride enters a marriage. Your spouse won’t care if his/her beliefs are wrong or right. They know what they want and will try to convince you to do things their way.</p>



<p>Some days you will wish they can do things in a certain way. But no one will care about you.</p>



<p>We need to be aware all these struggles will happen. How you all deal with those problems. Will determine if your marriage will work or fail. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no such thing as a perfect marriage. Only families with better problem-solving skills.</p>



<p>If they do things your way all the time. You are selfish, maybe your partner won’t tell you. But that selfishness and not the right way to treat your family.</p>



<p>Both partners must have a voice and play a part in how we arrive in conclusions. You must include your partner in your decisions. You must talk it through and come out with what seems to be a win for both of you.</p>



<h2>Why it so hard to forgive your spouse</h2>



<p>If your spouse upsets or lets you down. It is difficult to forgive. If you forgive someone, it means you understand what they did to you. But you will no longer hold it against them.</p>



<p>This process is not as easy as it sounds. Your spouse must help you in forgiving him or her. If they are not sorry for what they did or defensive about it. Forgiving become very hard.</p>



<p>It gets easy to forgive your spouse. If they sit down with you and talk about the problem. Telling you they understand what they did was wrong. They are sorry and it won’t happen again. They completely understand there is nothing they can do to make this right. Except for saying sorry and they feel bad while take a responsibility for it. <strong>Last, they feel bad that it hurt you.</strong></p>



<p>That helping your spouse forgive you and it make it easy. Once your spouse understands that you know what you did was wrong. They can forgive you and let go.</p>



<p>What will make this hard is when your spouse says “I didn’t do something wrong, what your problem? Just get over it”. This makes you even more upset because they did something wrong and they are not sorry about it.</p>



<p>Your spouse is not taking responsibility and they make you sound crazy for even talking about it. This makes it hard for a marriage to be healthy and moving forward.</p>



<p>This becomes a problem if your spouse hurts you over and over. Without being sorry because it keeps adding up. Even if they always come around and ask for forgiveness. It raises a question if you love me the way you say you do. Why do you hurt me in the 1st place? It&#8217;s hard to forgive someone who constantly hurt you.</p>



<p>So, until there is a change in their behavior it never easy.</p>



<h2>Cheating in marriages</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/affairs-in-yourr-marriage-1024x576.jpg" alt="affairs in your marriage" class="wp-image-855"/></figure>



<p>Cheating is the worst issue in marriage and it is hard to recover from it.&nbsp; We see it happening more and more these days. If someone cheats, they can’t blame anything or anyone. Rather than blaming themselves.</p>



<p>What disturbing there is no way to make a relationship be 100% affair-proof. You can do everything right but that doesn&#8217;t make you safe. You can even be a church person in your marriage. It still doesn’t guarantee your partner won’t go out.</p>



<p>The only thing that will stop your spouse from cheating on you is themselves not you.&nbsp; If they constantly remind themselves, they have someone who loves them back home. Making it their responsibility to control themselves from temptations.</p>



<p>You can only 100% guide you, with your partner you can’t be 100%.&nbsp; But you need to trust them when temptations come. They will do the right thing.</p>



<p>There are things you can do to control yourself. Like telling yourself I can’t be alone with another man. Because I’m married. I can’t have things like male friends. All that increase the risk and your chances of doing the wrong things.</p>



<p>We live in a digital age and we see more and more cheating starting from texting. Then keep growing until it something physical. Naked marriage is important than ever. If you are married there is no need for privacy. I must know everything about your passwords and accounts.</p>



<p>Cheating is a process. People start by talking, then dates before they will even sleep with each other.</p>



<p>Knowing everything about your partner still doesn’t guarantee your spouse won&#8217;t cheat. Though it decreases the chances of this happening.</p>



<p>I had a friend who was married and had two phones. One stayed in the car and he was only using it for cheating. Even with transparency we still can’t be sure cheating won’t happen in marriages.</p>



<h2>Parenting-styles differences</h2>



<p>Married couples turn to have different views when it comes to parenting. An example of this is when they discover their son is gay. It usually easy for a wife to accept the son as he is, but for a husband, it takes some time.</p>



<ul><li>Some parents let kids regulate themselves and be more like a friend to them. Instead of being a parent.</li><li>Some parents demand obedience from their kids. If kids don’t obey, there will be a tough consequences.</li><li>Some parents have high expectation, yet loving at the same time. Not too hard on kids not too soft.</li><li>Some parents just don’t care about their kids at all</li></ul>



<p>With this different style of parenting, it causes a problem in marriages. Especially in marriages where step kids are involved. Most wives like to raise kids in a friendly way. However, dads are usually hushing ones. This can sometimes lead to conflicts in marriages.</p>



<h2>Connecting with your busy spouse</h2>



<p>If you marry someone, you must agree. For better or worse you will stand by them.&nbsp; Even when you get busy and life gets busy. You will stand by them.</p>



<p>Connecting to your partner is so important in a healthy marriage. Me personally I really can’t stand hours without talking to my wife. Even when I am busy, I make time. I want to know how she is doing and how her day is treating her.</p>



<p>Busyness leads to neglect. Once you neglect your partner, they get lonely. If loneliness enters your marriage. Then it’s time to eliminate things that are not your priority. Like friends and everything that might not be your priority. Use that time to connect with your spouse. Marriage must be the number one priority of all time.</p>



<p>The wife can do so much at home to a point where the husband feels neglected. If you clean, cook, and put so much effort into helping kids. Sometimes that can make us as husband feel left out.</p>



<p>If you feel this way, then talk about it find a solution and balance.&nbsp; Because as small as this sounds, it can make a husband cheat on you. If he is feeling left out. Once he cheats the small problem is now a big one. You really need to connect with your busy spouse in your marriage.</p>



<p>It is not nice to miss your spouse while you stay with them. Couples slowly drift apart and later realize there are no longer in love. They are just a roommate.</p>



<h2>Feeling like a prisoner in your marriage</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/prisoner-in-your-marriage-1024x576.jpg" alt="prisoner in your marriage" class="wp-image-857"/></figure>



<p>Marriages are not child’s games. Many people get into marriage unprepared. If you enter marriage not knowing your partner enough, or if you enter marriage not knowing what is a marriage, or chose a wrong spouse. Then we can safely say you entered a marriage <strong>unprepared.</strong></p>



<p>Happens a lot and they realize later. This is not something they wanted. But it difficult to end a marriage, there is so much to lose.</p>



<p>Your wife moved out of her home and they are not expecting her to come back. You as a man you stand a chance of losing half of every you own. Their kids don’t want you to break up. Because they will have to pick sides. You lose respect and time. That a lot and that why most people end up feeling trapped or feeling like prisoners in their own marriage.</p>



<p>If it was a relationship, my advice would be to end a relationship. But since it a marriage, I can’t advise you to do that. Instead, I can advise you to take responsibility and say this is my marriage. I’m going to fight for it. Start writing everything that making your marriage to move backward. Try to fix those issues.</p>



<p>Find people with similar problems. Whether it podcasts or online communities, or social media it doesn’t matter. Find them and understand. How did they overcome the same problems that you are facing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time when I’m angry at my wife and I listen to the podcast. I usually find out even though I’m angry. I’m also wrong and it is great to find advice from people who don’t know you.</p>



<p>Because they don’t hide the truth from you. They tell you everything as it is.</p>



<h2>Financial abuse in marriages</h2>



<p>Financial abuse in marriage is real and something most people are not aware of. Yet it plays a huge role in marriage problems and divorce. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Let look at housewives as our example. Some homemakers stay home by choice. They have talked about it with her husband, and the husband has no problem with providing for a family. If a wife wakes up one day. Start saying honey, I want to work now and be independent. The husband says no! because she wants her to always depend on him. That is financial abuse!</p>



<p>Financial abuse comes in many forms in marriages. There are situations where your spouse knows nothing about your finances. Where they are and how do use them. Inside marriage, this is abuse. Marriage will never be healthy. Until there is trust and transparency. If you hide your money from me. It makes me wonder, <strong>what else are you hiding from me?</strong></p>



<p>The other form of financial abuse we see all the time. When your spouse wants details of every cent you spend. If you went out and did shopping without them knowing. Even if it something useful which was really needed. They will still be mad at you.</p>



<p>Because you didn’t talk to them first. This is financial abuse, and it&#8217;s not like your partner was hiding it from you. If she tells you, “while you were working, I thought we needed this, so I went out and bought it”.</p>



<p>Financial abuse leads to domestic violence in most marriages. We live in a world where it cost money to do things. This is sad if you want to make your partner be 100% dependent on you.</p>



<p>When you don’t even give them the freedom to do things they like. Just because you are the one providing.</p>



<p>Another practical example is when your partner is gambling vast amounts of money. You end up not knowing if there will be enough money left by the end of the month to pay bills. The days when your spouse lost in gambling, he will come home grumpy to everyone.</p>



<p>That financial abuse and it is sad to think some families go through all that.</p>



<p>learn <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/how-do-you-express-love-to-your-family/">how to express love to your family</a></p>



<h3>What is not a financial abuse in marriages</h3>



<p>If you set a budget together. Talk about how are you going to use both your finances. That not abuse but working together! When the money comes. You both know what are your priorities. How much you will be spending and how much you can use in your personal needs.</p>



<p>If your spouse wants to be involved in your financial decision that not abuse. If we are married it no longer your money but our money. So, it&#8217;s nice if I get involved in decisions. Especially if the result is going to effects the family.</p>



<p>If your spouse asks you about the budget. That also not financial abuse you need a budget in your marriage.</p>



<p>But if you avoid all these questions about the budget. Yet your spouse wants to know. Then you are abusing your spouse. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Smartphone-Hurting-your-relationship-1024x576.jpg" alt="Smartphone Hurting your relationship" class="wp-image-849"/></figure>



<p>There is a common pattern that has been growing around the world. Couples fighting for the reason that the other partner is obsessed with his/her phone.</p>



<p>This issue of smartphones is serious, and we have seen a lot of breakups. We still expect to see more. Today let talk about how you can avoid all that. I have been a victim of this, where I was in a relationship. Which ended because of the other girls I was chatting too.</p>



<p>This was wrong of me and it is something I’m not proud off.</p>



<p>I also dated someone who was so obsessed with my phone. She will try to page my phone every minute she gets. When I was in the bathroom, sleeping, or whenever she can get her hand on my phone. Sometimes while I’m using my phone. She would force me to show her, what I was doing or who am I talking too. I will have to explain every girl on my phone. Who is she and how am I related to her? It went on like that until I said you know what I can’t take this anymore.</p>



<p>The last one was the worst! If she logs in on WhatsApp and finds me online. She needed to know who was I online with. If I check any messages in the middle on the night. We will talk about the last seen in the morning. </p>



<p>Occasionally she will even require a screenshot. So, she can see who I was talking too. Which was unwise. I used to delete any conversation which can annoy her fast. Then send her the screenshot she wanted.</p>



<p>It was unhealthy, and I had many unhealthy situations in my past relationships. All around smartphones and a little of insecurities.</p>



<h2>The pain caused by smartphones</h2>



<p>It is toxic what these phones do in our relationship. If you use them the wrong way.</p>



<p>People are unhappy, there was this girl some other day. Who was complaining about her inboxes, she was getting each day.</p>



<p>Saying she get over 400 inboxes per day from different guys. She wants to reply, but it is too much. She doesn’t even know where to start. So, she always avoids them all.</p>



<p>Now think about what her boyfriend feels about that. We are dating and I’m loyal to you. Yet you get 400 inboxes from different guys. All of them with one intention, which is to date you.</p>



<p>How painful is that? I understand she doesn’t reply. Which we have no proof she ignores all of them. The fact she gets them is painful on its own.</p>



<p>The sad part about this issue of smartphones. If a partner asks about the phone. The one who is obsessed with using a phone. Will ask “why do we have to fight about my phone all the time because it is my phone?” which is true. Though it is a wrong thing to say to your partner. It shows you don’t care about their feelings.</p>



<p>Using smartphones constantly while with your partner. It makes your relationship feels disconnected. Your partner feels like a second choice. Important people in your life are the ones on your phone.</p>



<h3>Issues phone can cause in a relationship</h3>



<ul><li>Creates distance.</li><li>Creates conflicts. The person who feels ignored will try to talk to the high phone user.  The addicted user will try to be defensive. So, they can get back to using their phones. This then led to conflicts.</li><li>Counted as cheating. If you are with other people online all the time. It feels like a betrayal.</li><li>Creates Secrecy. If your partner is constantly guiding their phone. It kills trust and a good relationship are built on trust.</li><li>Pornography is another problem with smartphones and relationships. If you are in a relationship and your watch porn all the time.

<h2>When dating someone obsessed with their phone</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Phone-obsession-1024x576.jpg" alt="Phone obsession" class="wp-image-848"/></figure>



<p>People are really obsessed with their phones. They take their phone with them when they are going to the toilet. When they eating dinner. Even when they are making love, and they hear the notifications. They think about check it or do it a few seconds after they finish making love. Someone won’t even take the conversations seriously. Because while you talk to them, they are busy scrolling. </p>



<p>It can be on WhatsApp, Instagram, tick talk, or whatever. Some use social media for business. Some are influencers and it hard. Telling someone who makes a living on her phone to stop using it.</p>



<p>It can get so addictive to a point where they will completely forget about you. Or the plans they made with you as a partner. Which leaves you feeling neglected.</p>



<p>How do you know when it becoming an addiction, and it becomes a problem in your relationship?</p>



<p>If it getting in a way, you probably communicate or how you are being close with your partner. If your phone is feeling like a third person.</p>



<p>Then you must know it starting to be too much.</p>



<p>Talking about it and understand why they use the phone all the time. Sometimes it helps since to some it is business.</p>



<p>But if it not business, yet your partner is always on the phone.</p>



<p>it creates problems.</p>



<p>Even when your partner uses it for business. They must be limit. No one work 24/7, you need to have time to do other things. Time for your family and time to think.</p>



<p>The question we must ask, Is your phone more important than your relationship? If your answer is no. Then you really need to start and have a balance.</p>



<p>Even when you are not a social influencer. You still need to ask yourself that question. What is my priority here? Is it spending time with my partner? Or scrolling on and posting pictures on social media. Teach yourself to spend time with your partner and check your phone some other time. </p>



<h2>Fighting phone addiction</h2>



<p>Social media apps are created so we can use them all the time.</p>



<p>They collect data from everyone and use that data in us. So, we can be looked at by our phones every day. They can sell their product fast. It is your job to protect yourself from this addiction.</p>



<p>If you are on social media and you see sponsored posts. Someone is benefiting from that. If you are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?gl=ZA">YouTube</a> and you see ads. Someone is making money through those ads.</p>



<p>So, it obvious they all want us to be addicted so, they can make more money. If I can give you one tip that will change your life forever.</p>



<p>It is simple, turn of all your notification<strong>. Just turn off</strong> all off them. Because they are the ones that trick you to check your phone all the time. If you use Facebook all the time.</p>



<p>Go to your settings – go to apps – go to Facebook – go to notification</p>



<ul><li>Disallow notifications</li><li>Disallow priority display</li><li>Disallow status bar</li><li>Disallow banners</li><li>Disallow display on lock screen</li></ul>



<p>You can do this process for all the other apps you are addicted to. If they bring no value in your life. It will change your life dramatically and instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your phone turns off maybe because of the battery and the minute you turn it on. You get a lot of notification you are locked in your phone right away.</p>



<p>If you turn off your notifications. You will still be on social media. The difference is that you won’t get notified every time someone likes, comment, dm, inbox, tweet, etc.</p>



<p>You will only log in when you want to, not when you get a notification. Notifications can come every 3 seconds. But you won’t even know someone sent something. Until you log in on your own time.</p>



<p>Not only notification tempt you to check your phone. Once you check that one notification, and you log in you get more notification. Then your start checking other things.</p>



<p>It hard to regain focus again even if you were busy with something else.</p>



<h2>Using your phone to help your relationship</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/use-it-the-right-way-1024x576.jpg" alt="use it the right way" class="wp-image-850"/></figure>



<p>It clear by now phones are bad for most relationships. The good news is there are ways to use your phone to make your marriage or relationship better.</p>



<p>Phones can be bad if you use them badly. But can make a tremendous change if used the right way.</p>



<ul><li>You can use your phone to find out. What you can do to grow your relationship. Even by reading this post, the aim is to help you use less time on your phone. So you can focus on your partner, your life, or your job. That was the 1<sup>st</sup> step you using your smartphone to help you fight addiction.</li><li>Use your smartphone to connect with your partner. It is different to connect with your partner and connecting with the world. Me my wife use google hangout to connect. The reason for that is we tried things like WhatsApp. But it chaotic out there, you got your friends, family, and haters all in one place. So, we used <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">hangout</a>, and I only to her on hangout. We talk and video call one other. Because when she is not around, I want to know what she is doing. We want to be available to each other as much as possible. It important to show your partner she is the most important person in your life.</li><li>For your phone to help you make your relationship strong. You can not have any secrets from each other. You can’t be afraid at any time if your partner picks your phone up. No need for passwords and patterns. Live open with no secret.</li></ul>



<h2>Respect your partner privacy</h2>



<p>If your relationship is still new maybe 1 or 2 years and your partner hasn’t trusted you enough. For you guys to share everything like password and smartphone.</p>



<p>It nice to respect the privacy of your partner. That what I have been teaching myself over the year. If you check your partner’s phone without them knowing. Even if you find something is still wrong. I understand if you are married you can not be having secrets. If it just a new relationship and they don&#8217;t feel ready to show you everything.  Then don’t! because if your partner doesn’t want you digging but you do. You will find what you are looking for.</p>



<p>You may not find what you looking for, maybe you will find worse.</p>



<p>Let me tell you my story about digging into the thing you must stay away from. I used to love YouTube, and every time I go there. People will talk about the dark web. I avoid it for so long because they were making it clear it the unpleasant side of the web. But it also tempted me. So, I downloaded the onion browser. Because it wasn’t possible at the time to access it with any normal browser, which we use in our everyday life. The first site I went to was hidden wiki. It was the only one I knew, the first thing I saw was the library. I love books, so I check them out. Downloaded more than 100 books without even opening an account. Went back to hiddenwink tried other links and the things I saw there. Hunts me even today, it hard to get out my head. I have been trying for so long. Not only that, the book I downloaded there was all hacked, and they used them to still my information. </p>



<p>I could have avoided all that by just staying away from the dark web. The same thing with the smartphone, we tell people all the time to respect your partner&#8217;s privacy. If your partner is not comfortable, don’t. Stay away from your partner&#8217;s phone. Unless they give you that right. Very few are listening and they get what they want. After that what happens it ends in tears.</p>



<p>It doesn’t always mean your partner is cheating if they have a password and won’t give it to you. Sometimes they are worried about their bank apps and confidential emails like bank statements.</p>



<p>But you think why would your partner hide her phone to you it means there is something going on. You are making your relationship unhealthy without proof.  </p>
