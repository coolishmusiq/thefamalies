<p>As adults, we are conditioned to encourage our children to share their toys, food, or anything else they have in their possession. Teaching our kids to share not on help our kids, but it also makes us <a href="http://How%20to%20be%20better%20partners">better partners.</a></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Helping-Your-Children-Learn-To-Share-1024x576.jpg" alt="Helping Your Children Learn To Share" class="wp-image-532"></figure></div>



<h2>Why is sharing important for a child</h2>



<p>Kids are born blank and they don&rsquo;t understand what is happening to the world. So they need our help to understand what right and what is wrong. Most kids cry if they want something, that because we teach them if they cry they will get what they want. </p>



<p>However, if the kid cry yet, they don&rsquo;t get what they want. Eventually, kids change their focus to something else.</p>



<p>We may not even question why our kids should share, other than it&rsquo;s the proper thing to do. It is much easier to teach them to share at the early stage than when they are adults.</p>



<p>Children don&rsquo;t naturally share their possessions, it&rsquo;s a behavior that is learned. It&rsquo;s a wonderful social skill, provided that sharing is taught from the perspective of abundance and spreading love as opposed to lack and sacrifice. </p>



<p>When kids reach the age of 2+ everything seems to become an issue.</p>



<p>Sharing Is A Learned Behaviour. Most babies will play with what is in front of them. If we take it off them, we may upset them. </p>



<p>But most of the time they will just play with something else.  If another child takes a toy off them, it is a full-blown tantrum. </p>



<p>Around the age +2 years is the best time to teach your kids to share.</p>



<h2>What do you do when your child won&rsquo;t share?</h2>



<p>If you give your kid something else to play with, this will usually solve the problem.</p>



<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t work for some kids, so what should you do?</p>



<p>Understanding your child needs to strengthen and build connections. Sometimes the best you can do is not to intervene. </p>



<p>Give your child the chance to learn to socialize. Because as parent sometime we are quick to jump to conclusion and try to resolve things and don&rsquo;t let our kids work out their own strategies.</p>



<p>But monitor them closely to make sure they don&rsquo;t fight. Over time, your child might learn the skill to share without you taking action.</p>



<p>The following video explains more about what I was talking about and gives you additional tips on what you can do if your kids won&rsquo;t share.</p>



<iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TEAJqIB63Nc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<h2>How Do Children Learn To Share?</h2>



<p>Children learn most things from their parents. This means if they see you doing something. They will copy the same. A parent needs to be a leading example in everything they want their children to do or to become.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="border-color:#fcb900"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color"><p>Monkey see monkey do: Model behavior in early childhood</p><cite>according to <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/monkey_see_monkey_do_model_behavior_in_early_childhood">Michigan State University</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mainly it is a by the example of others and actively showing and guiding them on how to. As your child grows older, you can reason with them and they also understand more of the situation. When they are young, you may sometimes need to intervene.</p>



<p>You can model sharing behavior at home, share your snacks with your partner, share your cuddles with the family, or if you have a special treat, that you want to share, &nbsp;by all means, share!</p>

<h2>why is sharing so important?</h2>



<p>Learning to share can be tricky for kids, but it a vital life skill. Not only they will use that skill in their childhood, but they will need it as adults. </p>



<p>It can be at work or relationship, even in school.  <strong>If you don&rsquo;t have the skill to share, it&rsquo;s hard to make and keep friends.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sharing is caring</strong> if you teach your kids to share, not only they learn to share. But they also learn to care for other at the early stage.</p>



<h2>Sharing Creates Harmony</h2>



<p>If a child takes a toy away from another child, you must give the toy back to the child and explain that someone is already playing with it. They can have it after they have finished. For the child that does not have the toy, you can redirect them to a similar or another toy for them to play with. After some time they will become better at this.</p>



<p>I normally make an exception on this rule if the toy is special and acknowledge it was my fault for leaving it out while other children were about. Having a security teddy bear or blanket or something else picked up and played with can be upsetting to a child. Even I would get upset or anxious&nbsp;if someone started messing around with my favorite possessions.</p>



<p>When a toy is taken from a child and their parent says let the other child have it you have played with it for long enough or you need to learn about sharing, this is sending a lot of wrong messages to the child such as you must stop what you are doing to accommodate for others as you are not important enough.</p>



<p>If another child really wants a toy, you can try encouraging your child to share and describing what this is all about. It is up to you to determine whether they are at a point they will understand the situation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/children-studying-togetherness-boys-preview.jpg" alt="kids sharing the book." class="wp-image-247"></figure>



<h2>Sharing Isn&rsquo;t About Sacrifice, It&rsquo;s About Spreading Goodwill</h2>



<p>The main point I wanted to get across is that sharing isn&rsquo;t about sacrificing for someone else and teaching your children this. There is normally a way to get both children to be happy and to encourage your child to share for the right reasons of making someone else happy or realizing that they can let someone else play with something and it will be available for them to play with later.</p>



<h2>Teach Abundance And Sharing Becomes Easy</h2>



<p>When children are sharing such things as food make sure there is plenty more if needed. Teach your child there is more than enough to go around and back this up if needed.</p>



<p>This will ensure they aren&rsquo;t entering sharing situations with a sense that they must get as much as they can because otherwise they will miss out.</p>

<p>I recently had the horrifying, gut-wrenching experience of thinking my child had disappeared. </p>



<p>Our middle son managed to open the locked front door and go for a wander up to our street. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful that our street is a quiet street, and that there is virtually no traffic. </p>



<p>However, there is nothing more terrifying than those moments where you run through the possible scenarios of what could happen to your precious baby.</p>



<p>Here, my child had gone next door to visit our lovely neighbour, who upon discovering her little visitor, immediately called me to ask if I knew he was there.</p>



<p>Little master 2.5 had a chat about not sneaking out without telling his mommy where he was going, and I installed a few extra precautions on the front door locks. (It did cross my mind to lo-jack the boy)</p>



<p>What sprung to mind was how grateful I was to have an attentive and considerate neighbour who had my phone number, and knew to call me.</p>



<p>We are living in a world where the community isn&rsquo;t what it used to be. We&rsquo;re more connected online than we are to our neighbours in our streets.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on this experience, and a business book that I teach my coaching clients. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful book by<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Well-Before-Youre-Thirsty/dp/0385485468"> Harvey McKay called &ldquo;Dig Your Well Before You&rsquo;re Thirsty&rdquo;</a> and it&rsquo;s designed for business owners, but very apt for anyone.</p>



<p>The message in the book is to ensure that when the worst should happen, you&rsquo;re prepared, and have a network of trusted people you can call on for assistance.</p>



<p>When we first moved into our neighbourhood, I made a point of introducing myself to our neighbours. </p>



<p>Some are lovely, others I&rsquo;m not so close with, but I&rsquo;m ever so grateful today that I have a relationship with our street.</p>



<p>There are several key relationships that I feel every family should nurture and have in place:</p>



<h2>At least one good friend that you could &nbsp;call at 2am</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve always said if you can count your close friends, on one hand, you&rsquo;re very blessed. </p>



<p>Every mother, every family, should have at least one special, supportive, through a thick and thin friend who they can call on at 2 am.</p>



<p>In situations of joy, and in situations of agony, there is nothing like a good friend.</p>



<p>The best way to make a friend is to be a friend. Who trusts you enough to call on you at 2 am?</p>



<h2>A wonderful, understanding, supportive health care provider</h2>



<p>Having a health care provider whose wisdom you can innately trust is invaluable. </p>



<p>My family is incredibly blessed to have the care of a wonderful chiropractor and naturopath. Whose care has been incredible, but more importantly, their collective wisdom and advice has proved repeatedly to be something we couldn&rsquo;t live without.</p>



<h2><strong>An excellent educator for your children</strong></h2>



<p>Your child&rsquo;s education is what gives them the tools to be, do, and have anything they choose in their lives. </p>



<p>A wonderful educator will help your child be empowered to create the life of their dreams.</p>



<p>That educator might well be you, in which case, who are your educators and mentors? Who is helping you grow and realise your own dreams and ambitions?</p>



<h2>An excellent accountant to assist you with your financial security</h2>



<p>As someone who is not motivated by money, it&rsquo;s very reassuring for me to know that my financial affairs are well looked after and that we are slowly but surely building up a nest egg to protect us in our old age.</p>



<p>I know that if the worst should happen, my children will be provided for. I know that if the best should happen, we&rsquo;re set to retire comfortably.</p>



<h2>Your close neighbours and community</h2>



<p>As I&rsquo;ve proved today, my neighbours are a blessing. They&rsquo;ve been a blessing on over one occasion. When I was in a car accident, and couldn&rsquo;t get hold of my darling wife on her phone, it was my neighbours who notified her of what happened, and that I was OK.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve been there for our neighbours too when washing machines have broken down, we&rsquo;ve assisted with putting through a few loads of washing.</p>



<p>There have been countless cups of coffee and wonderful chats. perhaps a little of indulgent gossip about neighbourhood goings-on, and lots of over the fence catch-ups.</p>



<p><strong>Neighbours are a blessing.</strong></p>



<p>So dig yours well before you thirsty. You&rsquo;ll never know when you must call on the relationships in your life to help you out of a sticky situation.</p>



<h2>Being friends</h2>



<p>Even if you recently bought a house, you need that one good friend. Someone you can talk to and advise one another on how to deal with certain issues facing your community. </p>



<p>Sharing will increase your knowledge about the place you currently live in. Also, create a healthy environment for your family around the area.</p>

<p>These are my top ten natural parenting tips for new parents. If only I had known&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100418022757im_/https://www.naturalparentingtips.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/things-i-wish-i-knew.jpg" alt="10 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Was A Parent" class="wp-image-663"></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">1. <strong>They Aren&rsquo;t Out To Manipulate You</strong></h2>



<p>This means your baby doesn&rsquo;t cry his/her little eyes out because they are just trying to get attention or manipulate you in some way. They are either hungry, sleepy, uncomfortable (wet nappy/diaper, hot/cold) or bored. </p>



<p>Figure which one it is and they stop. Even if you have just changed their diaper 2 minutes ago, check again, I have been caught out before. Go through each one and you will get it.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>2.&nbsp;Talk Your Child Through Everything</strong></h2>



<p>Even if they can&rsquo;t speak yet or you don&rsquo;t think they even understand a word you are saying, just say it anyway. You will&nbsp;find things go a lot&nbsp;easier. </p>



<p>I have found this even works when I am putting down a completely asleep toddler, but need to change&nbsp;him first. </p>



<p>If I&nbsp;say everything I do&nbsp;before I do it, he stays asleep and even wriggles around to make it easier for me.</p>



<p>it create a connection at the early stage that will last forever.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t Bother About The Perfect Looking House</strong></h2>



<p>Maybe when they are 10 years or older, you could keep a reasonably tidy house, but before then prepare for food everywhere, toys and dirt. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t bother resisting it, go with the flow. They are a few things you can do though. Eat outside as often as possible. Use toy rotation in your toy room, and a big chest to store all the toys. Keep your re-flooring and expensive furniture until afterwards.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>4.&nbsp;Covers</strong></h2>



<p>If you have any furniture, you would like to keep, buy a cover for it, same with the car and all the tables. Covers save items. Make sure you have a few for rotation so it doesn&rsquo;t get dirty when you are washing one set.</p>



<p>cover can also be easy to wash, keep that in mind.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>5.&nbsp;Spend As Much Time With Them As Possible</strong></h2>



<p>As much as you probably hear it, the years&nbsp;pass&nbsp;quickly. And I am not talking about spending&nbsp;as much time with them on the weekend or as possible. </p>



<p>I mean, if you are working drop one day a week, or more, at the end of your life would you rather have more in your bank account or more memories and a great relationship with your children? </p>



<p>You can&rsquo;t buy them&nbsp;it later and you make more of a difference in the world by being a great parent than having a lot of stuff and money. (just a note, I&rsquo;m not saying stuff and money is bad, I certainly like it, you just need to determine priorities. </p>



<p>If you can fit both in, then I say go for it.)</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Child&rsquo;s Health</strong></h2>



<p>Your child&rsquo;s health is most likely one of your top priorities. Your child will most likely catch and show symptoms of many illnesses throughout their childhood. </p>



<p>But remember,&nbsp;billions of children have all been there before. Every little snuffle doesn&rsquo;t need a panic attack. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worse with your first child as everything is new. Make sure you have your health care professional number or health line number (if your country has one)&nbsp;handy and a quick ring can easily put your mind at ease. </p>



<p>I know you might sometimes want to wrap them in cotton wool, but little bodies are amazingly resilient and can handle almost anything&nbsp;thrown at them. </p>



<p>Viruses / Bacteria are a natural part of life and amazingly enough, catching for example the measles actually primes their immune system. Childhood illnesses help them live healthier lives and strengthens their immune system.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheap Is Better</strong></h2>



<p>As they all say, get a child an amazing toy and watch them play with the cardboard box. </p>



<p>I have found that the best toys are simple ones in which you play with them. </p>



<p>Paper airplanes, cardboard boxes, toilet roll, park,&nbsp;nature walk&nbsp;or a ball are extremely fun and provide many more laughs.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>8.&nbsp;Saying No Or Yelling Makes It Worse</strong></h2>



<p>I know there can be points where you get that frustrated, you just want to yell back at them. </p>



<p>Regrettably from personal experience, saying no, or yelling does nothing other than make it all worse. </p>



<p>Go an vent your frustration in another room and then come back and think of something to do, or a way to change the situation. </p>



<p>If you yell, prepare for more screaming and a worse situation.</p>



<p>Before saying no to a child, try to think of something else to do. Saying no keeps them still focused on what you are trying to get away from them. </p>



<p>If you suggest something else or a number of other things, you will eventually get them to play or do something else. It works very well, though may take just a little of perseverance.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Children&rsquo;s Copy EVERYTHING!</strong></h2>



<p>Not only will they repeat words and things said at awkward moments&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100418022757im_/https://www.naturalparentingtips.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">, but they learn your personality traits, habits and how you handle everything. </p>



<p>You are teaching them how they will act as an adult. If you have bad habits either don&rsquo;t let your children see at the very least, but it is best to better yourself to help your child grow into the best they can be.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never Be Afraid To Better Your Parenting</strong></h2>



<p>If I never tried to better my parenting,&nbsp;I would still do some things that today I would feel guilty about doing. </p>



<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to accept you may have done something wrong by your child, I have personally had to accept this a few times, but ignoring it just so you don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty about it only means you harm your child longer. </p>



<p>I know I am still not perfect, but I am always open to new ideas and better ways to be a better parent, as I want the best for my children, regardless of how it makes me feel.</p>



<h2>conclussion</h2>



<p>If you are thinking about having a child but waiting for the right time. There is never a right time. Get it now, time is running.</p>

<p>One of my friends asked me, is jealousy in a relationship normal? Because he gets more and more jealous lately. He trusts his girlfriend but can&rsquo;t help it. He gets jealous over minor things, even the ones that mean nothing.</p>



<p>Jealous in the common relationship problems. Human beings get jealous so easily. But you need to learn how to control it. Because it can ruin your relationship. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t take it seriously, it can cause marital relationship problems. This will make it hard to communicating in a relationship.</p>



<p>Start now and help yourself stop jealousy and possessiveness. This will help improve your relationship. </p>



<p>The following video will help you stop jealousy for ever!</p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zExmfQqQekw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<h2>What usually triggers jealousy?</h2>



<p>Several things can trigger your love partner&rsquo;s jealousy. If you feel anything can harm your relationship, it can make you jealous. Let me make an example. If your partner is about to go with friends, the fear of what will happen. </p>



<p>Since you won&rsquo;t be present, it will make you jealous he might have so much fun that he won&rsquo;t even miss you, can also trigger jealousy. Some experiences can make them jealous. </p>



<p>Low self-esteem can drive jealousy. Especially with women they from time to time feel less attractive and confident. It can be caused by looking up in other people&rsquo;s relationships too much. Not spending enough time with your partner can be an issue.</p>



<h3>Feeling insecure</h3>



<p>Many people for emotional insecurity in their relationship. For overcoming insecurity you understand it goes hand in hand with jealousy.</p>



<p>You may feel your partner is thinking about breaking up with you all the time. If you feel this way it time you get self-help for insecurity.</p>



<p>Dealing with jealousy and insecurity in a relationship is something you can do yourself. But you can also talk to your partner. So he can help you with fighting insecurity.</p>



<p>What you might find out is your partner is facing the same problem since this is the common problem.</p>



<h2>Unhealthy jealous behaviour.</h2>



<ul><li>Assuming your partner is not attracted to you.</li><li>Accusing your partner of cheating with no proof.</li><li>Checking your partner&rsquo;s phone without permission.</li><li>The tendency to compare yourself to others.</li><li>Fear of not being good enough.</li><li>Asking your partner to ditch his/her friends.</li><li>Show up uninvited.</li><li>Choose who your partner can talk to and can not talk to.</li><li>you are always suspicious.</li><li>Demand attention.</li></ul>



<p>These are the red flags! If you see these in your relationship. It time you sit down with your partner, try to find the solutions. Learn how to behave in a relationship! Know when you are being jealous. This will help you avoid several things. Including a quick temper, which is an enormous problem on its own. One minute you want to chat, the next you angry they take too long to respond. Jealousy can be abusive.</p>



<h2>How to stop jealousy actions?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-to-stop-jealousy-actions-1024x576.jpg" alt="How to stop jealousy actions" class="wp-image-776"></figure>



<ul><li>Trust your partner he/she is old enough to know what right and wrong. Sometimes you may not believe them, act as if you believe. Get enough proof then you can act on it. If your partner says I love you, believe them.</li><li>Understand every relationship is different. Comparing your relationship with others won&rsquo;t bring anything good. You can both learn one or two things from others, but don&rsquo;t force that into your own relationship. You have your own qualities, they have theirs.</li><li>Understand you can lose your partner. The less you worry about losing your partner, the easier it would be to fight jealousy. Enjoy each moment, but be prepared for anything. It okay to fear losing someone, but try to use that fear for improving your relationship. Do everything you could.</li><li>Respect your partner and make sure they respect you. If someone loves and respects you. They will know what they can and can&rsquo;t do in front of you, even when you not around. If they respect you, you won&rsquo;t be jealousy.</li><li>Be honest about how your partner&rsquo;s actions make you feel. Talk about those feelings. Listen to what your partner has to say.</li><li>Understanding jealousy is not a call to action. Jealousy is a feeling because you feel that way doesn&rsquo;t mean you are right.</li></ul>



<p>How to control jealousy will depend on what causes you to be jealous. Secondly, the type of jealousy that you have.  You may have obsessive jealousy. This can make you think your partner is unfaithful, accompanied by compulsive checking of partners&rsquo; behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or you may be jealousy that your partner is doing well.</p>



<p>There are many types of jealousy each you must overcome differently.</p>



<p>Insecurity causes most of the time jealous. That the best place to start is fighting your insecurities. </p>

<h2>Anger and jealousy</h2>



<p>Anger and jealousy go hand in hand. Jealousy produces&nbsp;emotions such as&nbsp;anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness or disgust.</p>



<p>This creates an unhealthy relationship for you and your partner. Some addicted in spending time with their partner.</p>



<p>If the partner is going to spend time with someone else they feel these tremendous bursts of anger build up inside them.</p>



<p>Which puts your partner in danger of your anger. You need to understand where is your anger coming from. </p>



<p>Controlling your emotions is easy. But you must know where are those emotions coming from. If jealousy makes you angry. Find out where is that anger coming from.</p>



<p>sometimes it can be because out what your partner did in the past, or things that happened in your childhood. </p>



<p>For example, if growing up in your mother was having more than one partner and she was doing that in front of you. </p>



<p>You will have a hard time trusting women. Therefore, it is important to know where is my anger coming from. So you can take necessary actions to deal with your jealousy and anger.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/family">Family&nbsp;</a>is one of the most important and has always been the most important thing in our lives. The bond that links your genuine family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other&rsquo;s life. </p>



<p>If there is respect, no one can break that family. A family is a risky venture, because the greater the love, the greater the loss. A happy family is an early heaven, it is what most people pray for.</p>



<p>A family is a place where principles are hammered and honed on the anvil of everyday living. But it a test of freedom. Because the family is the only thing that a man makes for himself and by himself. </p>



<p>For children, trying to understand the changing dynamics of the family may leave them distracted and confused.&nbsp; A child needs to realize that <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">if her family is full of caring people, her family is special.</span></strong></p>



<p>Effect on the family may differ according to family structure. The family may again experience feelings of anger and depression.</p>



<p>Your family can also share a photo album, a family calendar, and even help locate each other&rsquo;s missing devices. We can play family music that the entire family can enjoy together. </p>



<p>The support of friends and family can play a very important role in someone recovering from depression.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Benefits-of-having-a-family.jpg" alt="Benefits of having a family" class="wp-image-613"></figure>



<p>The Family that believes in God has Everything. However, I am not saying you must take your family to church. <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Believing that there is God</span></strong> can be enough for most families. </p>



<p>The family does not only mean people you share the same blood with, but it can also be friends or work partner. &nbsp;It can be anyone you share your tragic secret with, without them using that against you.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Funny things together as a family.</h2>



<ul><li>You can cook and bake together as a family. While allowing kids to help where they can.</li><li>Plan a picnic at the beach or pack, put food in the basket and just enjoy life.</li><li>Indoor Treasure Hunt for Children can be a cool idea. Give them clues to find location or items, even candies.</li><li>Go on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and learn simple magic tricks and play with children.</li><li>Play puzzles is another classic way to have a good time with your family.</li><li>Watch family movies.</li><li>Plan a Christmas party around the summer.</li><li>Plant seedlings and watch everything grow kids love that.</li><li>BBQ day, we all enjoy having a barbecue and cooking outside.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Create a healthy family lifestyle</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Create-a-healthy-family-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Create a healthy family lifestyle" class="wp-image-614"></figure>



<p>Teach your family to eat healthy and organic food. The entire meal doesn&rsquo;t have to be organic, but must always have at least one organic piece.</p>



<p>With long working hours and school for kids, eating organic can be a good thing in the evening. Get kids involved in the garden at an early age. Kids must be proud to bring vegetables in the kitchen and some fruits.</p>



<p>Organic food can help a family live a long and healthy life. If you love and live with your family, it is less likely that you will die from drugs or any terrible addictions.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">The benefit of spending time with your family</h2>



<ul><li>You develop parenting skills, the more time you spend with kids the better you will understand them.</li><li>Improves your kids learning skills both at home and at school. If kids are happy home, they are more likely to perform better at school and at home.</li><li>Spending time with your family also creates a good family bond. The family feels close to each other and this always a delicate thing. Understanding your family fully requires a lot of time. It is not something you can do in a week.</li><li>More chance of success if families support each other, even in threatening times they have your back. The more time you spend with your family will increase your chance of success.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Family values</h2>



<p>Now let look at something which is important,&nbsp;family values. No one is born knowing what their family values are, but it is what we learn as time goes.</p>



<p>They are important to the structure and well-being of the family. They always reflective of their times and environments, yet most cultures share several common threads for basic values and morals. </p>



<p>When parents show that family values are important, a child gets the structure and boundaries needed to find his or her own place within those values and morals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image is-style-rounded"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/download-3.jpg" alt="Mother Teresa" class="wp-image-616"></figure></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What can you do to promote world peace? Go home and love your family.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots">



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Mother Teresa</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>You can discuss with your family what they value the most. Formal meetings to discuss family values are not always necessary. But they help in most times. </p>



<p>This can be the backbone to a healthy family, can be the foundation that guides us. This can reflect who we are and how we parent.</p>



<p>Family values are the foundation for how children grow and are taught. We usually pass traditional family values from one generation to the next, giving children the structure and boundaries in which to function and thrive. </p>



<p>If you come from an excellent family you are more likely to have a wonderful family of your own. When it&rsquo;s time to do so. Strong and consistent family values are important in building trust and confidence in each family member. </p>



<p>Therefore, it can have a positive impact on your children&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>



<p>Throughout my experiences, I have noted time and time again how cultural and household values can affect career decision-making. Instilling good family values can assist your children to reach their full potential at school.</p>



<p>Eventually, your family values will be specific to you and your family. A solid set of it will allow each of us in our family to make it through the tough times. </p>



<p>A lucky family with strong values will produce children with high self-esteem, children who enrich the world around them, children who are catalysts of change.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Family reunion</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dercetus-%C2%B7-SlidesCarnival.jpg" alt="Family reunion" class="wp-image-615"></figure>



<p>Family Reunion is real, memorable, toe-tapping, heart-stopping, laugh out loud authentic moments. Seeing the entire clan at a family can be a lot of fun. </p>



<p>We can hold a Family Reunion between a mother and child, a brother and sister, a group of siblings, a group of family members including Elders such as grandparents, aunties, and uncles, cousins, nephews, and nieces.</p>



<p>They are outstanding expenses related to a small family reunion that is minimal and can be planned easily. But this will differ if you plan a family reunion by yourself, or it is the entire family idea. </p>



<p>They can be expensive, so they need excellent planning. If you will do it yourself, make sure you are financially ready before you tell the entire family. </p>



<p>It nice to do them often but this can be difficult if members are only close during the holidays, but it can become an annual event that all family members look forward to! </p>



<p>Setting a date for a large-scale event like a family reunion can be difficult. Because you need to pick a date where most family members can be available like Christmas time. </p>



<p>Planning your family reunion will be easier if you understand the family&rsquo;s objectives and reasons for gathering. What is important is to understand that not only adults will attend the reunion, but kids too. </p>



<p>Pleasant thing is that now you can hire some agencies for planning everything, to ensure that your family reunion will be memorable for all.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish you a great and successful life. Learn to <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/how-do-you-express-love-to-your-family/">put your family first</a> at all times. Love your kids with all you have and believe in them. You will face challenges, but you must never stop believing in your family. Always be available if needed. Surprise them and always learn a new thing to do with your family.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about couples parenting together hand-in-hand parenting. Nothing brings joy and trouble at the same time as having a new baby. But if you and your partner work together hand in hand, it will work out just fine.</p>



<p>60% of the couple&rsquo;s happiness drops upon parenthood. There are many reasons for this, how the baby should be carried for and by who. </p>



<p>The wives usually complain men don&rsquo;t do enough for babies. You will hear a man saying &ldquo;honey he&rsquo;s crying again&rdquo;. </p>



<p>Husbands feel cheated as their time alone with the wife is no longer available, crowded out by a baby with endless desperate needs.</p>



<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. There are things you can do together which will improve your parenting.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hand-in-hand-parenting-tips-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hand in hand parenting tips" class="wp-image-538"></figure></div>



<h2>Kids cry all the time</h2>



<p>Understanding crying is healthy, normal, and good for children. Crying is their way to communicate with us. Some parents whip their children for just crying.</p>



<p>However, sometimes you must let your child after they finish crying they think clearly. </p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t completely ignore my daughter when she cries. But I don&rsquo;t always intervene unless it necessary for me to do so. </p>



<h2>Set limits</h2>



<p>Setting limits for your child is not always easy. Most parent feel bad if they say no to their child and it is understandable because we love them.</p>



<p>But setting limits will teach our kids self disciples skills. limits also keep our children safer.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t set limits for your kids at the early stage. The result for that will reflect in your child&rsquo;s behavior when they grow up.</p>



<h2>Reward your kids if they did well</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/reward-your-kids-1024x576.jpg" alt="reward your kids" class="wp-image-542"></figure></div>



<p>Rewarding your kids if they did well helps you motivate and inspire your kids. Your children can easily understand what they are doing good and improve on that. </p>



<p>The rewards can be big or small but the idea is to tell a child you did well don&rsquo;t stop doing this. </p>



<p>Even candy can be a reward, but this depends on your child&rsquo;s age. They&rsquo;re pleasant things that our children do that need to be rewarded. </p>



<p>like when our kids are <a href="http://link%20to%20Helping%20Your%20Children%20Learn%20To%20Share%20Helping%20Your%20Children%20Learn%20To%20Share">learning to share,</a> we must encourage such  behaviors.</p>



<h2>Play with your kids</h2>



<p>I always encourage parents to be friends with their kids. Your kids need to respect you, but they must not be afraid of you. </p>



<p>If your child is experiencing difficult parent must be the 1st to know. </p>



<p>This why important to play with your kids so they are more relaxed around you. </p>



<p>Finding time to play with your kids is a good thing, but you must know when to stop.</p>



<p>There is a lot you can do with your kids play out door, play games, read books together.</p>



<h2>Mother and father parenting together</h2>



<p>Children have many benefits when a mother and a father work together as partners. Studies show that children become better when parents are together. A single parent faces major difficulties. </p>



<p>A single income and no one around for daily support.<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><strong> Being a single parent is not impossible, but it&rsquo;s difficult.</strong></span></p>



<p>Some parents may have a hard time with the father of the baby. But if they still stay together because a mother puts the child first. That can be a good thing in the long run.</p>



<p>Children need to have a special relationship with their father. A dutiful father will teach children the main important things. If a mother is encouraging the father to have a relationship with his children, she is not only helping the father but the kids too.</p>



<p>Parents can share the responsibility of raising their children. They must share everything, including expenses. So that no one can feel used. It&rsquo;s also important for parents to be honest about their feelings. They must understand relationship Romance might be over maybe it will continue after 10 years.</p>



<h2>The role of a father </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="border-color:#fcb900"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-vivid-red-color"><p>&ldquo;Anyone can father a child, but being a dad takes a lifetime.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Father&rsquo;s role in a child is always important. Fathers must provide security to a child. Not only that, but a father must also teach most activities at home.</p>



<p>As a father, you must be supportive and sensitive to your child. If you give your kids love and support, they make you proud.</p>



<h2>Supporting your kids</h2>



<p>Most studies show kids with supportive parent do well in school and in everything else.</p>



<p>You must actively encourage kids to do their best in school, hobbies, and interests.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t be hard on your kids, allow them to make mistakes. Have respect for their feelings and concerns.</p>



<h2>Providing a safe home</h2>



<p>To provide a safe home, both parents need to work together to provide their children with a safe home. Both parents must work together and teach their kids about the surrounding danger. </p>



<p>Lots of things can be dangerous to our kids like Jiki, electrical outlets, candles, and chemicals that are found in a home, etc. this thing can be dangerous to children. Parents need to work together to teach and provide a safe home.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Providing-a-safe-home-1024x576.jpg" alt="Providing a safe home" class="wp-image-549"></figure></div>



<p>Some parents are abusive, kids may need to stay away. If you plan to provide a safe home, you must work hand-in-hand and ensure no one abuses children. If children see both parents happy together, they feel secured.</p>



<h3>Things you can do while growing children&rsquo;s</h3>



<ul><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">going on dates</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">closing the bedroom door and teaching your kids to knock</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">teaching your kids not to interrupt your conversation</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">making sure your kids realize you have made up after an argument</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">kissing and hugging each other affectionately, not passionately in front of your kids</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">if you plan to parents together, you must also not forget to love one another if you treat each other with respect your kids will grow up treat others with respect</span></li></ul>



<h2>Rules for parenting together</h2>



<h3>Rule number one</h3>



<p>Never undermine your partner. It is easy to do this on a daily basis, but if you undermine your partner in front of your kids. It makes him feel powerless.</p>



<h3>Rule number two</h3>



<p>If you teach discipline, you must be disciplined. To teach your kids about making their beds, every time they wake up. Your bed needs to be on point every day. </p>



<h3>Rule number three</h3>



<p>If you or your children are being abused, ask for backup. The mistake most parents do when they are being abused. They keep quiet. You must ask for help. Otherwise, it will affect how your kids grow.</p>



<h3>Rule number four</h3>



<p>Avoid fighting in front of your kids. Nothing wrong with having arguments with your partner. But learn to take your fight into the bedroom. Fighting can frighten and worried children.</p>



<h3>Rule Number 5</h3>



<p>Never badmouth your partner, while trying to have a hand in hand parenting. you must teach your kids how to speak, and how not to. So if you talk badly about your partner. They will also learn that too.</p>



<h3>Rule number six</h3>



<p>Respect your partner parenting Style. mum can be mum and dad can be a dad. Kids will adapt and understand both. Therefore, they need you both.</p>



<h2>Family meals</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;family&nbsp;must always make time for a&nbsp;family&nbsp;meal. Even when parents work various schedules, they must try to make it at least once a week. It is important to have a traditional evening. sitting as a&nbsp;family&nbsp;asking kids about their day, how was the school, if they have homework or not. </p>



<p>This is not only about the meal. But to enjoy each other company. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what time you choose to make a&nbsp;family&nbsp;meal. As long as you make time for them some days you must take it out it&rsquo;s still a&nbsp;family&nbsp;meal but in a different environment teach your kids&rsquo; table manners.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Kids are a gift from God, and they need both parents. Love your kids, protect your kids, be there. Never be abusive! Reward them play with them. Be a perfect mom, be a perfect dad. Hand in hand parenting makes life for both parents much easy. </p>

<h2>What does a healthy relationship look like&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you want to have a healthy relationship. The perfect place to start is to understand what is a healthy relationship. Sometimes it is difficult, especially if you don&rsquo;t have a relationship to look up to. You end up not understanding what your partner expected of you. If you want to be a better partner, a healthy relationship has no master plan.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s what you both want it to be and it will keep changing as the time goes. A healthy relationship can also mean a recovering relationship. where you are both grow with the hope to be better partners. Understanding that it is a long-term thing, celebrating excellent times, and enduring good times and talking things out. The important goal is to satisfy a friendship and having meaningful moments.</p>



<p>It is difficult, but the commitment and the love you give each other is what will get you the long way. Once you fail to commit. You stand a chance to lose it all. You must never give up on a miracle. Your commitment must run deep. Hard things will happen you might lose a child, unable to pay bills, etc. but you must learn to appreciate what you have and learn to let go of the anger.</p>



<p>Staying together through hard times. Not forgetting to believe in God. if you introduce God into the relationship. You will help both of you, a few years later you will realize with commitment love can go along way. Forget what others think or will think. It will never be about them, but just you and your partner. Having the ability to meet your own needs and experience satisfaction. </p>

<h2>Finding your Vision</h2>



<p>We have talked about the number of tips. But now to find a Vision you must make a list and understand your vision. Talk about it and understand what you want to accomplish. While making your list, you must also talk about it with your partner. </p>



<p>How are you going to make decisions and solve problems? Because it&rsquo;s helpful to work out on Solutions together. Having a vision will make you a better partner and have hope. Your visions don&rsquo;t have to match. For example, your partner might like a small house. While you like the big house. But whichever you end up buying. The important thing is that you will still be together in that small or big house.</p>



<p>You can work on the differences over time. Save the list you have made. When you get into tough times revisit. you will see how helpful it is. Being better partners is something you must create together. Be honest and trust while you grow and change together.</p>



<h2>How will you get there</h2>



<p>This is your chance to learn fresh things about your love life. Forget what you have been told, but learn things on your own. Choose what means the world to you and your partner. Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>



<h3>Commitment</h3>



<p>Like I said above commitment is the first step in becoming better partners. But what it is? When you commit, let go of your previous experience, fear of failure, and the terrible things. Some confused commitment with</p>



<ul><li>medical benefits</li><li>child support</li><li>marriage vows</li><li>civil unions</li></ul>



<p>The paperwork has made us lose connection. We think of commitment as a legal document. But that, not the commitment. You can take all let out and still be committed. My purpose is to help you understand, all it takes is your good heart. If you commit, you are both deciding to be together, and face everything life throws at you so. One day you can be better partners, both of you don&rsquo;t know what will happen the following day. But whatever it is, you face that together. That why most people when they get married. You&rsquo;ll hear them saying for better or worse in the wedding vows. They know together, they can face anything.</p>



<h3>A road to Happy destiny</h3>



<p>Being better partners won&rsquo;t just happen. It results from growing together. Developing a new attitude and learning new skills. They allow girls in the family to grow up and leave the develop the necessary skills as children and be ready for a relationship. Girls grow up understanding what it&rsquo;s like to depend on others and them counting on you. They leave home with confidence and ready to engage in life. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520" width="276" height="183"></figure></div>



<h2>&nbsp;Intimacy</h2>



<p>Most people use the word intimacy for sex. But it&rsquo;s also mean</p>



<ul><li>emotional</li><li>mental</li><li>spiritual nature of intimacy</li></ul>



<p>Intimacy is not something you will get from the relationship. Rather something you will bring. It will get deeper as time goes. You and your partner will share things that you can&rsquo;t tell anyone. Such as fear, insecurities, hopes, and disappointments. I tell you something about me; you tell me something about you.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to be together spending quality time. Like doing the garden, watching movies, even cuddling her in the chair. That connection is what you need to be better partners. Relying only on each other. enjoying friendship and activities making a life together vibrant.</p>



<p>Intimacy will become everyday living and sharing experiences. You don&rsquo;t need to share everything, you can share insights and awareness, living-learning, growing.</p>



<h3>What to expect</h3>



<ul><li>boundaries</li><li>awareness of self and others</li><li>curiosity</li><li>honesty</li><li>reachability</li><li>a spirit of forgiveness</li><li>openness to influence</li></ul>



<h2>Fighting, but fighting fair.</h2>



<p>Regardless of what relationship Style, most couples argue about the same things. The most common.</p>



<ul><li>money</li><li>sex</li><li>time</li><li>children</li><li>extended family</li></ul>



<p>These are the argument you can expect in almost every relationship. But what will make better partners is how you deal with these issues.</p>



<h3>Money fight</h3>



<p>Money fight Will represent lots of things in your relationship. including</p>



<ul><li>power</li><li>security</li><li>time</li><li>personal success</li><li>even love</li></ul>



<p>Most have become so confused about finance in the relationship. It also causing lots of breakup and disagreements.</p>



<p>We all have our own beliefs about money. It&rsquo;s hard to change them. But for a healthy relationship, you both need to talk about money and conclude. Once you talk about money. It will create honesty and relief. Knowing how much you must spend and how much is enough. But we live a lie, which makes the other partner have too high expectations.</p>



<h3>Fighting for time</h3>



<p>Men are the ones that rarely have time. I think it is how they grow up. They are never in, they are always out with friends.&nbsp; But for your road to a healthy relationship. You must learn to adapt if your partner moved out of her home just to be with you. The least you can do is to be available.</p>



<p>We all have time, the problem is how we spend it. They must be enough time for you, me, and the relationship. The less time you spend with your partner. Will make it hard for me to reach my goal. To make you better partners. Even when you are not together, taking your phone and checking up on your partner is important. </p>



<h3>Fighting over children</h3>



<p>Fights about children is the most destructive, yet people continue to do it. common if someone started being a parent while growing up. It&rsquo;s fair to say no one likes to hurt have children. But if you get a child without a plan, it might cause issues. Parenting must be a way to increase your relationship and the best thing you can do is prevented children if you are still not ready. If you get a Child by mistake, adapt to the situation, and give a child love. It will help with being better partners.</p>



<h3>Arguments about sex&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is funny, it makes me laugh that sex is in this list of the things we fight about. Women say in a relationship men want more sex. When the women say no, then that&rsquo;s when they put pressure on them. This results in a fight about sex. Which is not even fair? but I&rsquo;m not saying girls don&rsquo;t want too much sex. I think we will have to make an article on how to resolve sex issues. Because it&rsquo;s a broad topic. </p>



<h3>The extended family fights</h3>



<p>Our family in the relationship can be our best or worst. What I have noticed over the years. If your family sees that your relationship is solid, then that&rsquo;s when they move back and let you be. With the extended family fights, you need to set boundaries. You will have your own answers on when to draw the line and be responsible. Finding the balance between your extended family and your immediate family is difficult. Cause it differs from each family, but to be better partners you must find the balance.</p>



<h3>Some rules that might help you fight fair.</h3>



<p>The fight can be healthy and it doesn&rsquo;t mean just because you know this, you won&rsquo;t get into them. Follow these rules.</p>



<ul><li>avoided talking to each other while tempers are still high</li><li>once you cool down that&rsquo;s the perfect time to talk</li><li>if you talk, focus on one thing, stop talking about everything all at once</li><li>don&rsquo;t focus so much on who is right and wrong rather stick to finding the solution</li><li>respect each other&rsquo;s decisions and stick to what you agreed on.</li></ul>

<p>Loving someone so much can make you insecure. Love never hurts on its own, if you are in love you should feel loved, you must feel happy and safe.</p>



<p>Once it hurts then it means it is no longer love. It can be depression, insecurity, or feeling neglected.</p>



<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovesickness">lovesickness.</a> When you have lovesickness, it is the pain that can produce negative feelings. When you are in love. Especially if a person you are in love, with is not in front of you. This can also cause a heartbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/What_does_it_mean_to_love_someone_so_much_it_hurts.jpg"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/What-does-it-mean-to-love-someone-so-much-it-hurts-1024x576.jpg" alt="What does it mean to love someone so much it hurts" class="wp-image-734"></a></figure></div>



<p>Most people, if they love someone so much it hurt, they rarely think it a disease. They believe this is part of being in love, while this can be true it is not always the case.</p>



<p>Some medical professor and in poetry sometimes they refer to love someone as madness. Passionate love will always fade, this can cause depression or sadness. Most of the time if a relationship is still new. Partners enter the honeymoon phase and within a year or two years it busts itself out. When the honeymoon phase fades that when most feel the lovesickness.</p>



<p>This is an expression. It can also mean we care for that person. When a person is in love, we must take them seriously. While this can be a pleasant thing, it can also be dangerous.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">List of common symptoms of lovesickness:</h2>



<ul><li>Extreme high level of mood or inflated self-esteem than normal</li><li>Depression, hopelessness, or helplessness</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Tearfulness</li><li>Insomnia, which may lead to fatigue</li><li>Lack of concentration</li><li>Loss of appetite or overeating</li><li>Stress, high blood pressure, pain in the chest, and heart. Acute insomnia</li><li>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Preoccupation and hoarding valueless but resonant items</li><li>Upset stomach, a change in appetite, dizziness, and confusion</li><li>Chronic neck pain, body tremors, intrusive thoughts, frequent flashbacks.</li><li>Rapid mood swings</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Love addiction</h2>



<p>Love addiction can also be a second cause loving someone can hurt you. If you spend every minute with your partner and for any reason. You cannot do that for a day it can make you feel sad. If you are in love, you can get addicted to several reasons like sex, silly talk, and more. You feel joys depend on your partner and if you cannot be with them, it hurts. </p>



<p>Bonding and having romantic love with emotions such as affection and trust. Can also make you deeply addicted to someone and the fear of losing them can hurt you. Some people don&rsquo;t experience love growing up and they finally get that someone special in their adulthood, they can&rsquo;t stand the thought of losing them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Love-addiction.jpg" alt="Love addiction" class="wp-image-738"></figure>



<p>Unconditional love is rare to find. Love where everything thing is complete and no one is trying to change anyone, love that has no bounds. But some of us are lucky to experience such love, and if that happens we never want that feeling to go away.</p>



<p>Sometimes that not how love works. Love has difficult times, so you can&rsquo;t always feel love. There is a famous quote that says &ldquo;those with an enormous heart, get hurt the most&rdquo; which is obvious. If you love someone deeply, you must experience sad feelings several times.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Selfishness</h2>



<p class="has-very-light-gray-color has-very-dark-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>If you are in love, and you do everything, you could to prove to your partner you love them. But no matter what you do, they seem to not notice your effort. This can hurt you. What breaks off friendships? It is envy and selfishness.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Selfishness.jpg" alt="Selfishness" class="wp-image-740"></figure></div>



<p class="has-very-light-gray-color has-very-dark-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>The same with the relationship. If you love your partner deeply, but they only care for themselves. It a shame and you have a right to feel pain. Lack of empathy is the root of selfishness. A happy relationship is when partners share everything. Both partners loving one another the same way.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Worry</h2>



<p>If you love someone you will worry about them, and you can not run away from it. Thoughts, images in our heads, emotions, and actions can make us worried about our loved ones. </p>



<p>Sometimes we worry because we have a negative memory of the past, we don&rsquo;t want that to happen again. If dating there is a lot you worry about from health to finance and more. If you think about all these things and yet no solution. It can bring negative thought to your head causing you to feel pain. It&rsquo;s a natural response to expected future problems.</p>

<p>Partners in a long-distance relationship turn to worry more. This is understandable, a long-distance relationship can be very hard. They come with a lot of optical and if you are truly in love. </p>



<p>You may worry a lot and there is nothing much you can do to change the situation. But in some long-distance, you are not even worried about losing your partner. Your partner being away from you can be the worst feeling.</p>

<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">When they go through personal problems.</h2>

<p>The book <a href="https://books.google.co.za/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=lsykAdteUYUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=love+someone+so+much+it+hurts&amp;ots=c7lx9TBg82&amp;sig=K38ekk16k3Ke-b_C_g2MOJUmDBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20someone%20so%20much%20it%20hurts&amp;f=false">Why Love Hurts: A Sociological Explanation</a> by Eva Illouz. Talks about from romantic fantasy to disappointment.</p>



<p>Romance drives the relationship. If there was a lot of romance in the honeymoon phase. This can make you feel connected to your partner.</p>



<p>What happens when romance stops? that when you might feel more pain. This is common in most girls they like to be touched in a certain way.</p>



<p>Even when they make love they like it done it a certain way. If you fail they get disappointed.</p>



<p>That does not mean they don&rsquo;t love you anymore. They still love you but the romance side disappoints them and that can create love pain.</p>
