<p>If you feel like your life is not moving. You have been at the same level for many years. It is time you step up your game. You can have everything you want just by believing you can.</p>



<p>Stop trying to belong, be selfish for once. Just focus on yourself.</p>



<p>Have planned moments with yourself and understand it is time for you to change. Even if it means cutting all your friends, social media, and everything that has been distracting you from starting your journey.</p>



<p>Friends can be a terrible inspiration. Think about what is it about your friend you love. What is it they bring to you or they are taking? It can be hard sometimes separating from the things we love. It needed some time so we can focus on us and accomplishing our goals. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HOPE-1024x576.jpg" alt="hope" class="wp-image-842"></figure>



<h2>The power of having hope</h2>



<p>I believe reading this today can take you to another level. Not only in life but also have respect in your relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can take the information that I give you today. Mine it and make it yours. Reading alone won&rsquo;t be enough. Start doing and start moving forward.</p>



<p>The wrong way of looking into success is to look at it as a destination. The finish line that one day you want to get to. No, don&rsquo;t look at it like that look at it as the life that you choose.</p>



<p>Look at it as something that yours already. If you want to be rich, start working hard like a rich man. Act as if you are there already.</p>



<p>Today I want you to believe that I can and I will be an overcomer. This will be true, you will get all you want and more.</p>



<p>We are all created to live in hope. That God has plans about me which will become a reality. So, I can become better for me and my family. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We were meant to live in hope, joy, and peace. Focus on hope today will be like rehearsing for your future freedom.</p>



<p>If we have hope, a lot of things happen. Your life may be in a tough time. If you have hope you don&rsquo;t get offended, you don&rsquo;t feel rejected or hurt.</p>



<p>All those offenses can&rsquo;t penetrate you. When there is an atmosphere of hope around you.&nbsp; When you meet people full of hope, you think life is kinder to them. But it only because they process things differently through courage.</p>



<p>Use your imagination the right way and it will lead you to the right things. Take the seed of faith. There is so much potential.</p>



<p>There will still be unknown. If you don&rsquo;t quite and grow worried. Everything around you perform better when there is hope. Your partner, kids everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Never forget the relationship works best when there is hope. </strong>Choose life</p>



<ul><li>Hope is a risky business and will get you disappointed most of the time. If you are going to live hopelessly, you will never get disappointed. But with courage even if you get disappointed, you are still going to simplify your purpose on earth. Whether your dreams come true. You trust yourself and your future. You will problem solve better when you have courage inside you. It might be a risky business, but great for problem-solving.</li><li>Hope is your choice. There are no hopeless circumstances, there are just hopeless people. What we need to do is control. Know what your thought are tonight. You get to choose what you focus your thought on. Whatever you focus your mind on. Will have a spike in your life the next day and the rest of your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Hope is not an illusion. It&rsquo;s not just wishful thinking but linked to the promises of God.</li><li>The power of words, can kill and give life. If you start a relationship. You only need your words, how powerful life can be. Even changing your life can only take a few words. You need to be very careful with the words you speak. What you want more, talk about it more. If you want more beauty in your life, take about it more. If you are in a situation of hopelessness. Talking about the positive and having hope can change your life. See your life with hope. Do not allow circumstances to dictate your life.</li><li>Hope is soil. It really saying I trust in him. Farms care for two things, seed, and the soil. If you take faith and hope, use it together and operate in love. You will be unstoppable. Do not wait for your certain circumstances to get better. Have hope now&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Stop making excuses to yourself</h2>



<p>Now after building hope. It is time for you to stop making excuses.&nbsp; Stop saying I want this, I want that. Now it is time for you to say I will get this <strong>no matter what.</strong></p>



<p>Not I wish, but I will. No matter how far away you are from it. Believing you will get it, will change your like. You may not get what you want. You will get other things in a process of getting it what you wanted.</p>



<p>Stop allowing yourself to get off the hook and have a commitment to the thing you want. Stop being a victim and blaming the past or your current condition. Hard work is all that you need in this world to get what you want. You don&rsquo;t even need talent.</p>



<p>Stop blaming things that are out of your control. Start using the things that are in your control. Ask your self what you need to do to be more like a champion. Instead of being a victim all the time. There are people who have originated in a worse situation than you and me. But today we praise them for what they have archived with nothing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Start doing, you will figure out things as you go. The way you do one thing is the way you do every. If you make excuses for yourself, you also make excuses in your relationship, you also make an excuse in your family, etc. when everything starts to go south in your life. You blade a lot of things. It is you who is making your life worse, by putting wrong energy in everything.</p>



<p>The way to get a lot of things done in your life is by you saying I will. Even if it gets hard. I&rsquo;m going to continue, anyway. If you stop giving excuses to yourself. You will see a change.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How to stop avoiding the thing you want</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/stop-avoiding-1024x576.jpg" alt="stop avoiding" class="wp-image-843"></figure>



<p>Stop avoiding things you want to do. Stop being afraid to do things you want in your life. You keep coming up reasons not to do them, that is avoidance.&nbsp; Fight avoidance and fight that fire inside you. Do you have dreams? Yet you avoid the first step you must take. Which will lead you into your dreams?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know people who can help. You avoid them, stop doing that today. You know everything you have been avoiding. Today you must sit down and ask yourself. Am I a bigger person than that or a failure who will never win?</p>



<p>Will you allow that small step to hold you back? Or are you going to get back in that momentum that you deserve?</p>



<p>Stop avoiding and ask yourself how can I attack this. Stop being lazy and defensive. Things you want, you must attack them all.</p>



<p>Ask yourself every day. What is it for me today? Not 3 days from now, not 4 months from now, and not when you hope it turns out.</p>



<p>Now! What must happen this day! Prioritize you have people who are going to depend on you. Be focus!</p>



<p>Always focus on what matters in your life. If your phone distracts you turn off. You can&rsquo;t afford any distractions.</p>



<p>Have a plan, if you don&rsquo;t plan you will burnout in life.</p>

<p>How to apologize to someone you offended and the power of apology. Saying I am sorry for hurting you can mean a lot to some people. But what I see is that it is very hard to apologize to a woman. Because even when you say forgive me, my love. They can hardly take that as a good apology and tell you to don&rsquo;t say it if you don&rsquo;t mean it. You think I have apologized, what more does she wants.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apologizing-1024x576.jpg" alt="apologizing" class="wp-image-815"></figure>



<p>Sometimes we don&rsquo;t even know how to apologize the proper way as men. Especially if dating, your partner will even tell you, to tell her, that you are sorry. But an apology is not something that you ask for, the person who did you wrong must always apologize. But not on your term because he must mean what he is saying. Not because you tell him to. </p>



<p>There are things you should never apologize for and there are things you should. It is your choice to beg for forgiveness. Women tell us when we upset them and we believe them. But do we apologize all the time, even when it was just a misunderstanding? <strong>Let talk about that.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">The do&rsquo;s and the don&rsquo;ts of apologizing</h2>



<p>The first thing we must understand when dating. You will never be loved 100% the way you want. I don&rsquo;t care if you have the richest man in the world or just a normal guy. Take out the thought people must be 100%. Because even you will be 100% in them.</p>



<p>What are the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of apology it a broad question. I am not an expert in apologizing and believe no one is an authority in apologizing. With apologizing will never be perfect. We all struggle in this, some do it more than they should. Some don&rsquo;t even know when to say it. Some don&rsquo;t even know how to react if you apologize to them.</p>



<p>The problem with most of us is when something happens. It is hard to accept that on me! Even though we are taught to say I&rsquo;m sorry. Most of us don&rsquo;t know how to say that well enough. So it means something to a person we are saying sorry to.</p>



<p>The apology is a gift and it tool that can be used to restore a relationship. More often to people we are close to. If you apologize to someone you say I care about you and I put the relationship first.</p>



<p>I care more about fixing your feeling than my pride.&nbsp; Apologizing is so difficult and it so humbling. Sometimes in saying I&rsquo;m sorry, you don&rsquo;t have the perfect words. You also fear saying wrong things which can make the situation worse.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to control such situations and sometimes. I just wish I can hide and don&rsquo;t apologize. Just forget anything ever happened and that not possible too.</p>



<p>But in this situation what helps is to think about the relationship. How much it means to you. How much you love that person and how much are you willing to keep it.</p>



<p>If you really care about them and you believe them. When they say you upset me. You have no choice, but to apologize. Even if you know you are not wrong. It not about you being right. But you saving your relationship. Also, you caring for that person.</p>



<p>You must admit you are not perfect. Even though that hard to admit to other people.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Thing we can do to apologize well</h3>



<ul><li>The first thing you must do when apologizing is to use I. if you are saying you are sorry you need to take the blame. You can&rsquo;t say you are sorry. But still blaming the person you want to forgiveness from. Women sometimes apologize to expose your bad behavior. Which is not a proper way to apologize to someone. Your apology must be about you, not the other person. Before apologizing it helps to sit down with yourself first. Understand why you need to apologize and how will you do it.</li><li>Find the right time to do it. You need to make sure the other person is in a state to listen. The perfect time to say I&rsquo;m sorry is immediately when it happens. But I understand sometimes it can take some time for us to realize no, this was wrong. The minute you realize, say you are sorry. Because the sooner the better. Because sometimes you can feel that you are not ready to apologize. Claim your self down and when you feel you can do it. Do it!</li><li>See it on the side of the other person. Because most of the time what makes it hard to apologize. We focus too much on what we think and forget about the other person. You may have a unique perspective. However, just because you have a different perspective. Really doesn&rsquo;t mean you are right based on their perspective.</li><li><strong>Sorry without a change is not enough.</strong> If you say I&rsquo;m sorry to someone. Your action must change afterward.&nbsp; If you are sorry, it means you will change your behavior. Otherwise, there is no need for you to apologize, if you won&rsquo;t change. Above I said the aim to apologize is to repair and if you don&rsquo;t change. You are still harming the relationship. Change is so important. Because if you did something. That oven yourself agrees it is wrong. Yet you are doing it again. It really brings attention to you as a person.</li></ul>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Things we don&rsquo;t do when apologizing</h3>



<ul><li>The first thing that I see all the time. When someone is trying to apologize they use but. <strong>Don&rsquo;t say But! </strong>Because when you say I&rsquo;m sorry but! Your but is the only thing that person receives. If you apologize to me. I like that and for a moment I think you care about my feeling. However, the minute you say <strong>but</strong> I forget everything you said.</li><li>Saying you are sorry. While you are busy doing the other things.&nbsp; This really doesn&rsquo;t count. If you apologize, you must pay attention to your words and be in that moment of apologizing.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t expect someone to forgive you. Just after saying you are sorry. Even if you know you said I&rsquo;m sorry respectfully.&nbsp; But the pleasant thing is that you did. It will also give you relief if they don&rsquo;t forgive you. They have a right to do so and that on them. Understand forgiveness is a process, and it happens over time.&nbsp; Some people need to see you change before they can accept your apology. Some accept it right away. I am one of those. If you say sorry to me, I forgive you immediately. If I don&rsquo;t forgive you now, I might never. But the rest is on me. What more important is that you came to me and humbled yourself.</li><li>Avoid apologizing using text. Try the phone call or in person. What I noticed about the text is that some people can read it wrong. You can say something and mean it. But the other person can read it and get the wrong viewpoint. Beside it more respectful to say in person or in a call. Rather than just text.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t have expectations of the other person. There are times in life where. Someone will deeply hurt you, and you sit there waiting for an apology that will never come. Sometimes you might get it. But it won&rsquo;t be the one you hoped for. So, it really helps to don&rsquo;t have high hopes with things like someone saying sorry to you. You can teach yourself to forgive people without them saying I&rsquo;m sorry. Because some don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry in words. But they do something nice for you to say sorry. You on the other hand sit there waiting for an apology. But they think they have apologized. You can not change some people the only person you can change is yourself.</li><li>Never apologize if you feel, you don&rsquo;t want too, and you are sure. You were not wrong. Instead, tell your partner. You understand what you did was wrong and you will do better next time. </li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">The power on apologizing</h2>



<p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Departments/Ombuds%20Office/files/M.Wagner.ColumbiaUniversity.OmbudsOffice.ThePowerofApologies.pdf">Harvard Medical</a> College made a study about the apology and the power behind forgiveness. People who are hurt or humiliated often wait for forgiveness. Why do we even need an apology?</p>



<ul><li>The first thing to be sure the same thing will never happens</li><li>To understand if something was done intentionally or not.</li><li>To repair our self</li><li>To earn respect</li><li>And to put that thing in the past</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nplinUox428?feature=oembed"></a></p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nplinUox428" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>This video explains how hard apologizing in men can be. But yet it is the most important thing for women. If you don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry. You build bridges with the person you are in a relationship with. You apology it the only thing that can fix things.</p>



<p>We sometimes think apologizing will make us look weak. But most of the time once you do it, it does the opposite effect. Most of the time in the relationship is wasted talking about the past. But this sometimes can be avoided. If we teach our self to say I&rsquo;m sorry when we are wrong. We can move on with our lives.</p>



<p><strong>Remember to say I&rsquo;m sorry and remember to say thank you. This will change your life.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Over apologizing</h2>



<p>We understand by now how important it is to say I&rsquo;m sorry. But do we really need to apologies all the time?  If we do what this says about us.</p>



<p>Once you teach yourself this, you can overdo it sometime. The problem with apologizing for everything. It creates this picture of you doing everything wrong. Just because you know you are going to say I&rsquo;m sorry. The more you say it, the more it feels unreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over apologizing can undermine you. It can also hurt your self-esteem, and no one is doing that to you. But you do that to yourself.</p>



<p>So, you need to find the balance. Don&rsquo;t overdo it, overdoing it doesn&rsquo;t always mean you say it over and over.</p>



<p>If you did something, and your partner is mad. All she need is your word that sincerely come from your heart. The roses can be nice. But once you start washing her car, calling her 300times, telling everyone to talk to her, showing up at her work, etc.</p>



<p>You are overdoing it and that not what she wants. That might frustrate her even more.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">When the apology is not accepted</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Apology-not-accepted-1024x576.jpg" alt="Apology not accepted" class="wp-image-817"></figure>



<p>When we say I&rsquo;m sorry, it doesn&rsquo;t always go as planned. Sometimes it can backfire hard and not always right away. It can backfire when you said you are sorry and then you went through and did the same thing all over again.</p>



<p>Sometimes your partner will be mad at you. But with no sufficient proof. Then you ask for forgiveness and it proves to her you did it. Which gets her even crazier.</p>



<p>They can use your sorry against you.</p>



<p>We don&rsquo;t like to request for forgiveness and find that they do not accept our forgiveness. But that does and will happen. There are things you can do if your admission of guilt is not accepted. Thich can help or stop the situation from getting worse.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>You must never take your apology back. Which you can take by your reactions. Because if you say I&rsquo;m sorry, you do it for the right reasons. If they reject you that on them.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be defensive or try to remind them how many times time they have been wrong, and you have forgiven them. It not about them this time, but you.</li><li>Give them space so they can process it.</li><li>Show your apology with your actions</li><li>Re-try visit some other time. Remind them you meant what you said and you are still sorry.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Exchange of apologies</h2>



<p>Sometimes your partner is wrong 50% and you also wrong in a way. But you must apologize to fix your partner and your partner need to apologize to you.</p>



<p>An outstanding example of this is when you did something wrong. Then your partner says hateful things to you just because you are wrong. After you apologize and your partner forgives you. The questions come flying in your head. If your partner really meant what she said to you.</p>



<p>Now even though the problem was about you. But they also need to apologize to you. So, you can heal too. Because what they said to you is very hurtful and you can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What usually helps me so I don&rsquo;t say hurtful things in the other person. I look into myself first and have respect for myself. Me respecting myself means I can say no, you can&rsquo;t say such things to others. Even if want to say it and it in my head. But I don&rsquo;t say it. Because I respect them more importantly, I respect me!</p>



<p>Exchanging apologies is great. Because in the end it not about you. If you made that person feel humiliated you own him too. Every time someone says I&rsquo;m sorry. It doesn&rsquo;t end there, you need to think about how you reacted to them.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t get defensive about it or make a justification. The reason you did wrong is that of what they did. NO, You had many ways to handle the situation, but you have chosen to be hurtful.</p>



<p>It is common for people who always expect people to apologize, to don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry too. Or if they do say there are sorry, they include but you have. Or say I am only apologizing because&hellip;..</p>



<p>Thich is total wrong and don&rsquo;t qualify as a proper apology.</p>



<p>The other thing which you must know about exchanging apologies. which I might have talked about early. If you say I&rsquo;m sorry that doesn&rsquo;t mean it fixes everything right away. So, they might not apologize back right away. It can take a few hours sometimes even longer than that.</p>

<p>I and my wife were talking about the other last night. It seems like people like to make a big deal out of the small stuff.</p>



<p>She used to be like this, and there was a time where I was like this. But as you grow older, you realize this not how you live with others. We all make mistakes, there is no need to fight about everything.</p>



<p>Because having a tendency to make a big deal out of minor matters can ruin a relationship. I always tell people not to start a fight unless it beyond your powers.</p>



<p>If you make big deal out of everything. That when your partner might say you talk too much. This can be the beginning of an unhealthy relationship.</p>



<p>So, today I&rsquo;m saying, <strong>Stop Making A Big Deal Over the Little Things.</strong></p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-RhYewEbOz4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Find good habits for your relationship. This is the nasty habit and you must find a way to of breaking this habit. It does more harm than good.</p>



<p>There are many good patterns you can teach yourself. Same as bad ones, if you want a healthy relationship. You must stop the bad patterns.</p>



<p>If you make a big deal out of every minor situation. This means you controlling, and no one enjoys being with a controlling partner.</p>



<p>Once you stop making a big deal out of everything. This is when you will learn the skill to solve problems, without fighting with your partner.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to know your partner is old enough to know right for wrong.&nbsp; No need to remind him no, this is wrong every time.</p>



<p>He already knows what he did was wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Always ask yourself is this worth my time. It is easy to shout at people until we lose them.</p>



<p>I understand it can happen, that your partner thinks it not a big deal. But it is for you. That also happens all the time.</p>



<p>In a case, where your partner thinks it not a big deal and you think otherwise. Talk to them like the adult. They would understand no need to fight every time.</p>



<p>If you have talked to your partner several times and he keeps doing the same. Then we can make it a big deal.!</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Preventing fighting from ruining your relationship</h2>



<p>The first thing which is wrong. We think relationship and marriages are hard.</p>



<p>So, when our relationship has problems. We take this as normal and don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. So, we can deal with it.</p>



<p>We get advice. Relationships are hard work. If you want to stay in a relationship, fight to keep it.</p>



<p>But you don&rsquo;t fight for a relationship, which is health. If you must always fight for your relationship, that not health. Some day you might realize no, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>



<p>The problem started when you believed fight is normal in a relationship. A single fight can be normal. But if it happens often, that not normal.</p>



<p>You will have arguments, issues, and hard times. But should not escalate to fights. Because in a good relationship there is clear communication and problem-solving strategy.</p>



<p>Consistent fighting and making a big deal out of small things. That not normal and it could be your strategy of dealing with fight is not working. It can also mean one of you is falling out of love.</p>



<ul><li>Falling out of love can make you fight for things that don&rsquo;t matter.</li><li>It can also mean you are angry about something. That you haven&rsquo;t addressed yet. For example, they do not please you in bed. So everything upsets you.</li><li>You could fight about something that happened in the past. You have talked about it and it passed. But months later you re-think it and be angry. This time you show your anger in other things. Even though it is still connected to what happened in the past.</li></ul>



<p>This can make your relationship unhealthy, and you might not even realize it. If this continues it creates a bigger problem. Can even end the relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Break the circle of fighting</h3>



<p><strong>Deal with what in front of you right now.</strong></p>



<p>What I mean is, don&rsquo;t talk about what happened yesterday or the other month. Instead, fix only what you are talking about now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Leave-the-past-in-the-past-1024x576.jpg" alt="Leave the past in the past. Where it belong!" class="wp-image-795"></figure>



<p>If you had a problem and talked about it. Then your partner apologized. If he apologized and you saw, he meant what he said. Never bring that up again. Even when you are fighting about something else.</p>



<p>If it is something that happened last week. It must be completely off the table. You fix everything as it happens and moving on with your relationship. Without allowing problems to add up on top on one another.</p>



<p>Keeping a record of everything is wrong. First, you did this second, you did that, now you are doing this. That all wrong! </p>



<p>Because you have talked about it and came up with a solution. Why are you even mad about it for a week or a month later?</p>



<p>When you keep bringing up things. Which happened in the past, over and over. You are not allowing your relationship to move forward.</p>



<p>When you focus at the moment. Your communication skills will improve.</p>



<p>If you keep everything that happened in the past. You will win the fight. But your partner knows what you did in the past, too. So, if he is also bringing everything too, he will win. This means the conversation is not going forward and the relationship.</p>



<p>If you forgive someone it means you put that in the past. If it too much to forgive don&rsquo;t continue with that relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Words you need to avoid when arguing in the relationship.</h3>



<p>Let me assume the reason for you to read this article is that you are in a similar situation. Where you and your partner are always fighting and one is making a big deal out of everything.</p>



<p>I want to warn you about two words you should avoid when fighting. These words are 1 <strong>always </strong>2<strong> never!</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Always-and-never-1024x576.jpg" alt="always and never" class="wp-image-798"></figure>



<p>It is something you never thought about before. But it is very damaging.</p>



<p>It can take some time to break the habit. Knowing this is something I should stop will make you one step ahead.</p>



<p><strong>Let me make an example of what I mean.</strong></p>



<ul><li>You are always starting a fight</li><li>You always messing things up</li><li>We always do what you want us to do</li><li>You always make fun of me</li><li>I always must do everything</li><li>You always ignore me</li><li>You never listen to me</li><li>You never cared</li><li>You never help</li><li>You are never romantic</li><li>You never put effort into anything</li><li>You never let me choose</li></ul>



<p>Think about it. The chances of never and always being accurate are small to none. We use always and never when we frustrated or angry about something.</p>



<p>What these words do. They also make your partner frustrated too. Because even though your partner was wrong. Your partner won&rsquo;t agree with what you are saying. This can start a separate fight on top of the one. You are already fighting about.</p>



<p>Two, it puts extra blame on your partner. For example, if you say your partner always mess thing up. This means since the day you meant them. They always mess thing up and that such a wrong thing to say.It not fair to say because it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>



<p>Get to the root of the problem. Solve that problem without involving everything that happened before<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t get to the root of the problem. You leave that problem unsolved. Because instead of solving it. You brought back the old one. Even those were not solved. Because you also brought the older ones.</p>



<p>This becomes a chain of unsolved problems, and they will keep coming up. Causing you to fight all the time!</p>



<p>This can make you make a big deal out of small things. Because a lot of problems are stuck in your head unsolved.<br>Let us say your partner is talking about something you do that they don&rsquo;t like. But they are not fighting with you yet. Telling you what they don&rsquo;t like.</p>



<p>If you respond by saying, you always picking a fight. This means you don&rsquo;t care about their feelings and you are reversing the problem to them.</p>



<p>The next thing that is going to happen. The fight will worsen. The other partner may even become more frustrated. Because you show you don&rsquo;t even care.</p>



<p>So, this way of handling things solves no problem. It makes things worse!</p>



<h4 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">If your partner use always or never in you. What then?</h4>



<p>There will be a time where your partner says you always do this, or you never do this. You as a person who already knows. How damaging those words can be. You must have a different manner.</p>



<p>If your partner says. You always pick a fight. You must keep calm and say come sit down here, let talk about it. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. That I always pick a fight. I know we need to be better in handling our problems. Show your partner you care about their feelings. </p>



<p>Ask them what is it moving forward that they want you to do. To solve this problem.</p>



<p>You are solving a problem. Instead of reversing the problem to the other partner or bringing up the past.</p>



<p>Understand what exactly is bordering your partner right now. What role can I play moving forward to make things better for us? How can we make this better together?</p>



<p>If you talk to your partner like this. They feel</p>



<ul><li>You are hearing</li><li>You respect their feelings</li><li>You care</li><li>You are working together as a team.</li></ul>



<p>By doing this, it can cool the other partner way faster. Showing you care, makes the other person feel loved and acknowledged. This is why you are together.</p>



<p>Your partner doesn&rsquo;t want to be angry. They are not speaking to you to annoy you. They are trying to solve the problem. So don&rsquo;t make the problem worse.</p>



<p>If you tell your partner &ldquo;you never listen to me&rdquo;. This means they have never listened to you, ever since you started dating. How true is that?</p>



<p>It like you are telling your partner, they are always wrong and the only reason you are still together is you. Which is not fair!</p>



<p>Each person has a unique mind and voice. Using always and never will make your relationship to grow apart. This will cause a lot of unnecessary fights. Without you understanding where they have come from.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Tips for fighting fair</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIGHTING-FAIR-1024x576.jpg" alt="FIGHTING FAIR" class="wp-image-807"></figure>



<p>This article is about a relationship. Where partners fight all the time. The relationship where everything turns in to a big deal. The aim is to help you reduce fight in your relationship. &nbsp;Because fight can turn even a perfect relationship into a sour one.</p>



<p>So, we need to look at this problem in many viewpoints and give you unique solutions.</p>



<p>There are many ways partners deal with the conflict. Both partners must not try to win the conversation. Without interest in solving the problem.</p>



<p>Both partners want the fight to end. But it cannot if the fight is going in the wrong direction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is a problem in your relationship. But both of you are defensive. It is less likely you will move forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do you fight fair?</strong></p>



<ol type="1"><li>There is a saying don&rsquo;t go to bed angry. It&rsquo;s time we rethink that. We must teach our self to take a break if something is frustrating us. Even if that means going to bed angry, it is fine we will talk about it tomorrow. But this will help us avoid saying things we don&rsquo;t mean because we are angry. It also gives us time to think. The next day you might even realize. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this anymore, it is not worth the time. This will help us stop saying things in a mean way, harsh and hurtful. Saying things that can&rsquo;t be forgetting.</li><li>The second method of fighting fair is the one we talk about early to stop using the words always and never. Because they are not accurate, and they do more harm than good.</li><li>Find a solution. Stop fighting back your partner. Work together so you can find a solution.</li><li>Focus on the present. Forget about the past wrongs.</li><li>Never interrupt your partner. Let your partner finish and give your viewpoint.</li><li>Apologize if needed.</li><li>Never fight in front of your kids. Children a copycat, if you fight opposite to them. They might fight the other kids at school. You might blame them. But it is you who are teaching them the wrong things.</li><li>Watch your words.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Conclusion</h2>



<p>If your relationship is always boiling and you fight all the time. Learn to listen to your partner. Forget who is wrong for a moment and focus on how we can solve this.</p>



<p>Be loving to each other. Find the strategy to solve problems in your relationship. But you can&rsquo;t come up with a strategy during fights.</p>



<p>Coming with a strategy will need both partners to be cool and claim. Talk about your bad habits that are costing a relationship. When you are both in the right space.</p>



<p>Communication is the key, talk to your partner, and a find solution. </p>

<p>Make sure, you ready are you. Find out is he dating someone currently. Check if has he made enough effort and do you love him or what you love what he did. If you were to date him will you complete him and what is his HIV status?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Birthday-1024x576.jpg" alt="Things every woman should do, before she says yes to a relationship" class="wp-image-680"></figure>



<p>Starting a relationship is a huge decision. But sometimes we just jump into a relationship without asking our self what am I getting myself into. Sometimes a relationship can work just fine. Though sometimes that can be a death sentence.</p>



<p>Just because a man came to you and told you what he wants. Doesn&rsquo;t mean he meant every word. The average men stop at least 3 girls per day and say the same words to all of them.</p>



<p>Now how can you easily trust a guy? I have found myself in a position where I talk to a girl, thinking I like her.</p>



<p>Then 3 weeks later, I don&rsquo;t want to be part of that relationship. Why? Sometimes we as guy enter a relationship just because someone looks good.</p>



<p>After we sleep with her that when we realize we never wanted a relationship.</p>



<p>As a female, you need to be careful before you start a relationship.</p>



<p><strong>Check yourself, check the person you are about to date!</strong></p>



<p>As you grow, you should worrier about wasting time. If you enter a relationship and a year later you realize it not for you.</p>



<p>You just wasted a year, and you are not getting any younger.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Is this man dealing with trust issues, emotional scares, or immaturity?</p>



<p>If you answer yes to any of these questions, that man may not be your best choice.</p>



<h2>How ready are you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-ready-are-you.jpg" alt="How ready are you" class="wp-image-687"></figure>



<p>If the prior relationship ended, it means somehow that relationship broke you.</p>



<p>Yes, the last relationship ended, but have you moved on?</p>



<p>If you are not ready, just tell a guy I&rsquo;m not ready. Stop entering a relationship with problems.</p>



<h2>Does he have a girlfriend?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Does-he-have-a-girlfriend.jpg" alt="Does he have a girlfriend? " class="wp-image-683"></figure>



<p>There is this strange thing most girls do. They ask after sex if you have a girlfriend or not. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If I say yes what different does is it make, we slept already?</p>



<p>&nbsp;You already have feelings for me? If a guy says I love you, you must find out if they have a boyfriend as easily as possibly.</p>



<p>Unless you are tolerable with being a side chick.</p>



<h2>Has the effort been established?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Has-the-effort-been-established.jpg" alt="Has the effort been established? " class="wp-image-685"></figure>



<p>Don&rsquo;t make it easy, even if you feel you love him. Make sure he will fight for this relationship.</p>



<p>If a guy doesn&rsquo;t fight to win a relationship, he will never fight to keep it.</p>



<p>A boyfriend or someone who is interested but doesn&rsquo;t make the effort to speak to you, or see you and show you he needs this to work.</p>



<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care. At the early stage of the relationship, a guy must cancel plans just to be with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A man who wants you should never be reminded to treat you the way you deserve to be treated.</p>



<p>If a guy makes excuses before you even say yes! Don&rsquo;t waste time, move on!</p>



<h2>Has he expressed how he feels about you</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Has-he-express-how-he-feels-about-you-.jpg" alt="Has he express how he feels about you " class="wp-image-684"></figure>



<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t wonder is he into you or not. He must express that to you. <strong>Don&rsquo;t assume</strong>!</p>



<p>Some women are ignorant, they believe some guy doesn&rsquo;t show emotions. Because of that how guys are wired. That the wrong stereotype.</p>



<p>Men express their romantic feelings, but not to every girl. If he expresses himself deeply you are special.</p>



<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t express himself, just know he knows how to. If you don&rsquo;t believe me wait until you do something wrong. He will express in every direction how what you did was wrong. If you think guys don&rsquo;t know how to express themself, think again!</p>



<h3>Stop relying on direct sighs like</h3>



<ul><li>The way he holds you.</li><li>The way he is always available when you need him.</li><li>The way he gives you money</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>While that can be a good sign it can miss lead you. Remember, we are talking about a guy you haven&rsquo;t said yes to.</p>



<p>He might do those things to sleep with you. You don&rsquo;t know if he has good intentions for you. Maybe after you sleep with him, he might start playing games with you.</p>



<p>Communicate like a human being. You are not an ape. Do you miss me and how do you feel about me? Those questions are wrong and the answer won&rsquo;t be honest.</p>



<p>To understand a guy, you must listen to him talking about you for several days. Paying attention to every word. Because some guys will even forget what they said the previous day and say something totally opposite. &nbsp;If he does that you know he doesn&rsquo;t mean what he is saying.</p>



<p>We as men are very romantic and we not afraid to tell you if we miss you. But if you must ask us if we miss you, then something is wrong. We can tell you what we see in you and if we can&rsquo;t express that.</p>



<p>Maybe we are not into you, we are just fooling around.</p>



<h2>Do you love him or something he did?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Do-you-love-him-or-it-something-he-did.jpg" alt="Do you love him or it something he did?" class="wp-image-682"></figure>



<p>Girls make many mistakes when they enter a relationship, and one of them is to say yes just because a guy did something.</p>



<p>Maybe just because he bought lunch. This why most relationship and marriages fail.</p>



<p>Once you take a girl out, she says yes. Once a guy does something she falls into a trap. Keep in mind we as guys know what you girls like and we do those things to win you easy.</p>



<p>But even so, as a girl you need to do your homework. Be sure if this is what you want. Know him, know his just past and more.</p>



<p>It is always good to write what you want in a man before you say yes.&nbsp; Understand if this man was to lose his job can you continue dating him. Can you learn something from him?</p>



<p>Jumping to things just because he did something once or twice. What if you jump in and a week later you realize he is abusive?</p>



<p>What if he can do nice things, but he is controlling as hell?</p>



<p>Do your homework, take your time look into him. Visit his social media to learn what type of person he is. Does he flirt with every girl?</p>



<p><strong>You must know all that to make a wise decision.</strong></p>



<p>My aim is to help you stop wasting time with the relationship that will fail in no time.</p>



<p>Without the magic of chemistry, a relationship can&rsquo;t sustain itself. If you say yes for the wrong reasons, you will be bored in that relationship and you will regret your decision.</p>



<p>Men who give you everything turn to do as they please. Most girls can allow them, but soon or late they realize they deserve better.</p>



<p>You can avoid all that drama and enter the relationship for the right reasons.</p>



<h3>What are the right reasons to enter a relationship?</h3>



<ul><li>To share, love</li><li>To learn and grow together</li><li>To have children with the right person</li><li>Friendship and fun</li><li>Mutual support</li></ul>



<h2>Do you complete him?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Do-you-complete-him.jpg" alt="Do you complete him?" class="wp-image-681"></figure>



<p>&nbsp;According to the bible woman were created to make a life on a man better.</p>



<p>If you see something wrong with your man and you don&rsquo;t care.<strong> You don&rsquo;t love him!</strong></p>



<p>Which is why it is a sin to sleep with a girl before marriage. A woman is with you to improve your life. So, as a man, you must respect that and make her your wife.</p>



<p>You must be thinking what this has to do with me saying yes to a relationship? A lot actually!</p>



<p>A guy will tell you why the last relationship didn&rsquo;t work. Will you make the same mistakes? Forget who was wrong in the prior. Understand what he is looking for this time.</p>



<p>If the prior relationship failed because her girlfriend cheated. You know you also have a problem with cheating. Then it is obvious you don&rsquo;t complete him, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like him.</p>



<p><strong>You are not in his life to make his life better, but worse!</strong></p>



<p>A man that had a problem with money spending and met someone who can help him. &ldquo;no baby this not how you use money, try this instead.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Even if they break up, he will always have a soft spot for her. Because she came with the change in his life.</p>



<p>You must always think is there anything I can do to complete this man.&nbsp; So that if any girl can come throwing her to him. He will see that girl as the trouble that is here to end his relationship, and he doesn&rsquo;t want that.</p>



<p>You can date a complete person, but somehow, they realize you bring no value to them and move on.</p>



<p>Man can stay for years with someone they don&rsquo;t love. If that girl completes him and pleasant thing along the way he realizes he can not live without her.&nbsp; Then you might hear him saying I never thought we would make it this far.</p>



<p>This means he was just fooling around and found value and stayed forever. Which is nice!</p>



<p>Therefore, man sometimes ends up marriage someone who was a housemaid. That maid brought more value than his girlfriend. Not that I encourage this, but it happens.</p>



<p>By me saying complete him. I don&rsquo;t mean cooking, washing, and buying things. Yes, all that can be nice. But even simple things like telling him to visit his mother. This alone can make him see you differently, especially if the previous girlfriends never told him to.</p>



<p>Some girls will sleep with a guy and make a request or ask for money, then go home.</p>



<p>They won&rsquo;t even ask &ldquo;baby you are working why don&rsquo;t you do 1 and 2? Because by doing this it can help you with this and this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>They make the relationship all about them. You don&rsquo;t call me anymore, you don&rsquo;t take me out, you don&rsquo;t give me money and more.</p>



<p><strong>But if you don&rsquo;t bring value, why expect one</strong>?</p>



<p>Listen to his story, take some time. Before you say yes, can you complete him? The relationship isn&rsquo;t a one-way street where a man must meet all your qualifications and you lay claim.</p>



<p>You both must work on something.</p>



<p>Any relationship can last six months to a year, but if it still growing after year, respect that relationship.</p>



<p>Be the right woman for the man you are falling for, not just because he meets your requirements.</p>



<p>Know why you are falling, don&rsquo;t think you will find answers after you start dating.</p>



<h2>HIV status</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HIV-status.jpg" alt="HIV status" class="wp-image-686"></figure>



<p>This is the second thing girls do wrong. They don&rsquo;t ask you about HIV status until it too late.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Most girl fears to ask a guy about his HIV status. &nbsp;But the truth is, asking alone won&rsquo;t help. He might not give an honest answer.</p>



<p>The best practice if you feel that you love him is to ask him to go with you. So, you can both get tested.</p>



<p>According to the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Story-AIDS-Experts-Questions/dp/1557989842">The Inside Story on AIDS: Experts Answer Your Questions</a>&rdquo;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/41R0K75XZHL._SX305_BO1204203200_.jpg" alt="the book &ldquo;The Inside Story on AIDS: Experts Answer Your Questions&rdquo;" class="wp-image-698"></figure></div>



<p>A person can be exposed to HIV and test negative. The book also makes it clear that you can have HIV and test negative.</p>



<p>How is this possible?&nbsp; If you have HIV, but your body hasn&rsquo;t started fighting it. Your body won&rsquo;t produce antibodies against HIV. Your immune system must discover the virus and produce the antibodies that will fight HIV.</p>



<p>Expect in this book say a person can test negative for 3 months to a year depending on your blood while he/she has HIV.</p>



<p>Now that we know that, what this has to do with you?&nbsp; Before you enter the relationship, asking if a guy has HIV won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>



<p>Because he might think he is negative and has papers to prove it. But we know you can test negative even when positive.</p>



<p>This applies not only to him, but to you too. You might think you are negative based on your last result, but maybe you are not.</p>



<p>Going for an HIV test together will help you both if you end up saying yes to relationship.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t do that and later you are both sick. Don&rsquo;t blame him, and he can&rsquo;t blame you. Just face the reality and talk about what you going to do now that you have it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>After doing all that it time for you to tell him I&rsquo;m ready for this relationship. Whatever you have been doing on your side, stop. Because I&rsquo;m your girlfriend now.</p>



<p>Talk about your likes and dislikes. I wish you a happy dating.</p>

<p>If you take a housewife. You must trust her to be a homemaker. That she will be by your side all the time.</p>



<p>Your job is to make sure she has enough money to buy things she likes whenever she like.</p>



<p>That a good thing, but sometimes that where the problem smart. Because you are working and she is at home, 247.</p>



<p>She does everything at home, but when she finishes, she might get bored and go out. If she goes out consistently without you since you are working.</p>



<p>Now there is a risk she might meet someone.</p>



<p>Women cheat as much as men do, but mostly for an emotional reason.</p>



<p>The sad part is that if you are working, it can take a long time. Before you even suspect your wife is cheating.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Smart-Graduation-Hat-PowerPoint-Templates-1024x576.jpg" alt="How do I catch a cheating housewife?" class="wp-image-671"><figcaption>How do I catch a cheating housewife?</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Signs your housewife is cheating</h2>



<ul><li>Her phone is always on silent.</li><li>She visits her family a lot.</li><li>She changed her passwords.</li><li>She accuses you of cheating.</li><li>She&rsquo;s asking to try new things in the bedroom.</li><li>She&rsquo;s ignoring you.</li><li>She gets mad at you about everything.</li></ul>



<p>If you see these signs, something can be wrong. But you need more than signs. </p>



<p>Now let look at the things you can do to catch your cheating housewife.</p>



<p>learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/why-cheaters-get-angry-when-caught-forgiving-a-cheater/">how cheaters reach if they get catch</a></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Act blind while suspecting your wife is cheating </h2>



<p>Even when you have started suspecting her. Don&rsquo;t ask her right away. </p>



<p>Get enough evidence, so that when you ask her. She can&rsquo;t fight it and tries to twist the truth.</p>



<p>She might say no, we are friends and if you don&rsquo;t have enough evidence. She will get away with it and try to be more careful the next time.</p>



<p>Act blind so she won&rsquo;t even know that you are after her games. </p>



<p>You must know what they have been doing. How long have they been doing it? Who is also involved!</p>



<p>Why you need all this? So, you will know if you can forgive or not. </p>



<p>the second reason so she can&rsquo;t get away with it and lie even more.</p>



<p>My point is you need solid proof.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Questions you should ask yourself about your cheating wife</h2>



<p>Before we go any further. You must ask yourself a few questions.</p>



<ul><li>What made you believe that something inappropriate is going on in your relationship? </li><li>How long do you suspect something has been going on?</li><li>Do you think the problem is getting better or worse?</li><li>What have you done so far to address and/or correct the problem?</li><li>How much would you say the situation has cost you so far? Emotionally, financially, and physically.</li><li>How much will it cost from here on out if you don&rsquo;t take some decisive action based on accurate?</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">High a private investigator&nbsp;for your homemaker</h2>



<p>A private investigator will have tools you don&rsquo;t have. </p>



<p>Some are even free and the perfect example is Uyajola99. This a TV show that has private investigators, and they can find out. What your partner has been doing while you were at work.</p>



<p>But the bad thing about Uyajola99, if they catch your wife. <strong>It will be live on TV.</strong></p>



<p>If you want some privacy, you still love your wife. Should hire a paid private investigator. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to dig yourself.</p>



<p>What also good about the private investigator. </p>



<p>After they have proof and solid evidence. They tell you on what you can do and what you can not do. </p>



<p>So, you don&rsquo;t end up in jail because you can.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Using mind control to catch a cheater</h2>



<p>How does this work? You start asking her question that can make her tell you the truth. </p>



<p>She will think you already know.</p>



<p>When in fact you didn&rsquo;t! you can ask her questions like what did you do last night? If she is guilty, she will want to know why you are asking.</p>



<p>You can continue with your mind game and say to her. It is funny how people can cheat on you and think you will never find out. </p>



<p>Again, if she is guilty, it will be hard for her to hide it. Because she will think you already know, in most cases she will break down and start telling you the truth.</p>



<p>But if she is not guilty, she will agree with your statement. </p>



<p>All you need are the right words, at the right time, to make your housewife think you already know everything.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Checking your spouse&rsquo;s phone</h2>



<p>If you can get your hands to her phone. Because you might know her password since she is your wife. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t look for the guy she is talking to. Most of the time that will be deleted frequently. But you must check the conversation with her friend.</p>



<p>Most girls have that one friend, that they tell everything and that good place to start. </p>



<p>Not only you might find who she is cheating with. You can also find why she is doing it.</p>



<p>Because girls share everything and all they talk about is men. Even when she regrets what she did, but doesn&rsquo;t know how to end the relationship. The only person she can tell is her friend. </p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Make use of technology</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Make-use-of-technology-1024x576.jpg" alt="Make use of technology" class="wp-image-672"></figure>



<p>Technology has come up with great tools. This can help you catch your cheating housewife. </p>



<p>You use things like<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/find-your-phone"> find my phone</a> to track where she is and tracking her alone won&rsquo;t give you a solid proof.</p>



<p>But you can track her phone. The second tip can be to use a flying drone to see what she is doing in that location and with who. How much time did she spend there?</p>



<p>If you get a good drone. it can take a video and take pictures from the distance. She won&rsquo;t even see there is a drown that following her. </p>



<p>Because she is your wife and you have the right to know the truth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-fly-a-drone">Learn how to fly a drone</a></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are other methods that you can use, like installing hidden cameras inside the house. The problem with that if she is doing everything outside the house, you won&rsquo;t find anything.</p>



<p>Your wife also knows even if you are at work. Neighbours can see her, and she can&rsquo;t trust them not to tell you.</p>



<p>The other method can be to ask her, but she might not tell the truth and up her game since you have suspicions.</p>



<p>You need to be careful about how are you planning to investigate. But I wish you find the truth and that after you find the truth, you take the right actions.</p>

<p>It is difficult to have a happy home. What makes this even harder, everyone understands happiness differently.</p>



<p>But who&rsquo;s job is it to make the family happy? The right answer is: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the job of every member of the family.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Mostly it falls on the shoulder of a mother and father, but everyone must play a part. If you think one person in your family must be responsible for family happiness. You are being unfair!</p>



<p>The family must do things together. This creates not only loyalty but a chance to build up and enjoy family affection.</p>



<p>Father and his wife must have a plan on how to keep family happy. The role must kids play. Because this won&rsquo;t just happen.</p>



<h2>Celebrate everything</h2>



<p>Little things matter! As a family, you have a lot to celebrate and you must celebrate all. Having a family is a delicate thing and should be promoted. This makes a positive difference and they must plan every celebration in time.</p>



<ul><li>Birthday</li><li>Anniversary</li><li>Kids pass at school</li><li>Christmas</li><li>New Year&rsquo;s Eve</li><li>Mother&rsquo;s Day</li><li>Father&rsquo;s Day</li><li>Life and more</li></ul>



<p>There is a lot to celebrate, and everyone needs to feel the love. A celebration will typically feature food and beverages, and music and dancing or other forms of entertainment. It&rsquo;s nice to be honoured as a person.</p>



<p>The person who is celebrated doesn&rsquo;t always have to know beforehand. You can organize a surprise party to the person in whose honour it is being held. </p>



<p>But it can also be a</p>



<ul><li>Block party</li><li>Dinner party</li><li>Graduation party</li><li>Housewarming party</li><li>Bridal shower</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>You just need to find what works for your family. Because each family celebrate differently, for example, for some families a block party can be a bit too much.</p>



<h2>Family need food lot of it</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-655"></figure>



<p>Food plays a huge role in keeping your family happy. In fact, this should be a priority for a good family. Without food, there is no happy family. We can own things like farms and gardens to help us provide for our families.</p>



<h3>Family garden</h3>



<p>I personally own a garden, Since I have learned to appreciate the value of gardening to better.</p>



<p>I love growing things, it can be vegetable, fruits, or flowers. This can be very helpful for your family wellbeing. You can decide what you want to plant in your garden. So you can feed your family.</p>



<p>Try to teach your kids at the early stage, the importance of growing food themselves.</p>



<p>You can get everything you want at the shop. But the vegetable from the shop can never be fresh as the ones coming straight from your own garden.</p>



<p>Besides the fact that vegetables give you good vitamins, you save money. Which can be used in other things. A large variety of vegetables and fruits can be stored in the pantries of our homes, and balanced meals can be served during the winter months and summer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>On your right hand is the picture of the garden. Which I and my wife own. even though we are working, we love getting vegetables straight from the garden whenever we can.</p>



<p>My wife loves cooking, and I love eating. We make sure we have for all the time. Even when we are broke, food is always available. </p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200827_180412-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-651"><figcaption>my garden </figcaption></figure>



<p></p>

</div>



<h3>Food shopping for everyone</h3>



<p>When doing food shopping you must think of everyone. If you have kids, you must know what they love. With providing for a family. The father must lead. However, every family member must contribute if they are working.</p>



<p>For the family to be happy everyone must play a role. It wise to do food shopping as a family. Just to make sure everyone has what he/she likes. Not only that, doing things together as a family is also a glorious experience on its own.</p>



<h2>Parent the right way</h2>



<p>Parents in the family must learn to parent the right way to keep the family. Most kids and teenagers go through different a thing and most are still learning how life works.</p>



<p>They might be at the stage where they think their parents are old-fashioned. Some think the parent knows nothing. Some think their parents treat them like babies.</p>



<p>As a parent, you must not forget that kids are growing up. So, you must understand them and help them grow. Kids need rules, but you must give them the right to talk about your rules.</p>



<p>They must know some behaviour is wrong. But don&rsquo;t force them to believe that right away. Kids have many questions in their heads, like</p>



<ul><li>Who am I?</li><li>Who can be my friend?</li><li>Who needs me?</li><li>Who can I be?</li></ul>



<p>Give them a chance to talk about themselves and help them feel good about themselves. For kids, to be happy they need to know their family cares for them.</p>



<p><strong>Praise them</strong></p>



<ul><li>when they help</li><li>when they are kind</li><li>and when they try</li></ul>



<h2>life satisfaction</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/life-satisfaction-1024x576.jpg" alt="life satisfaction" class="wp-image-656"></figure>



<p>Happiness can be defined differently depending on your culture. &nbsp;But in simple terms, it is the current experience of the&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;of emotion&nbsp;such as&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;or&nbsp;joy,&nbsp;or of a more general sense of &rsquo;emotional condition.</p>



<p>Happiness can also be life satisfaction. A person&rsquo;s mood and viewpoint on life can also influence the insight into their own life satisfaction. For your family, to be happy. You must be believing in family and have hope.</p>



<p>The nice thing about a happy home. The happier family has a greater tendency to like others, which promotes a happier atmosphere.</p>



<p>Family life satisfaction is improved by the skill of family members together realizing their family standards. It is important to study family life satisfaction from all members of the family from a &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; viewpoint and an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; viewpoint.</p>



<h2>Keep your family safe from coronavirus</h2>



<p>Your family must be safe from coronavirus. If any family member gets COVID 19, this can be dangerous and ruin family happiness.</p>



<p>Since it can pass from one member to another in no time. It important for you to teach your family self-care, wash hands and wearing a mask in public.</p>



<p>Until there is a vaccine. We must do our best to protect those we love during this time.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Having a happy family is nice. But don&rsquo;t think it will be like that every day. That not reasonable. Your family will still go through challenges like everyone else. If you love each other and stay together everything will be fine. <strong>I wish your family a happy life and don&rsquo;t stop loving one another.</strong></p>

<p>We will look at what a housewife does later. A housewife is not employed outside the home. However, some do work from home. Housewife works many hours at home and her husband supports her financially.</p>

<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">kids</h3>



<p>Most women love to be around their kids and stay-home moms give them just that. Their kids don&rsquo;t have to be raised by someone else just because mom is always working.</p>



<p>Homemakers don&rsquo;t have to worry about office stress. Because working nowadays can be stressful. Especially if you have kids.</p>



<p>If you are a housewife, you have a chance to prepare kids for school, make lunch for them, take them to school and fetch them later. You have a gift to watch your kids grow right in front of you. You are also responsible for most decisions.</p>



<h4 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Housewife with no kids</h4>



<p>It is possible you might not have kids at the beginning of your marriage. But you can still be the best homemaker, even you don&rsquo;t have kids. Just focusing on your husband pleasure and yours.</p>



<p>Besides, thinking about your husband all the time. You can also read books or watch Netflix during the day. You know what you love.</p>



<p>Even without kids there are always plenty of things to do at home.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Working for home</h3>



<p>Just because you stay home doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t work from home. Even though most housewives choose to enjoy their time and only focus on home duties. Which is fine, but you can also try to work from home during your spare time.</p>



<p>However, I advise you to talk to your husband first before you start working from home.</p>



<ul><li>You can start a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_transcription">medical transcription</a> service which involves transcribing audio or video reports from healthcare professionals into text format. It the simple job that can be done home and pays well.</li><li>Affiliate for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>, you can open a website. Start selling and earn a commission. &nbsp;While this is competitive especially if you are starting out. If done right, you can get good cash.</li><li>Start a blog. You can start blogging, maybe talk about the parenting-related topic and earn money through <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/">AdSense</a>. Most moms start this by doing it for fun and end up making serious cash.</li><li>Become a YouTuber and you can teach women how to be an excellent housewife. Like blogging, you will earn money through ads.</li><li>Invest in stocks. Save a little in stocks every month, you will be suppressed over time how much you can make if you manage your risk well and take proper classes.</li></ul>



<p>There is a lot you can do at home in your spare time. You just need to find what fits your style and do that. I can not choose for you because I&rsquo;m not a financial advisor. Just helping you understand there is a lot that you can do.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Things you can do all day as a homemaker</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Things-you-can-do-all-day-as-homemaker-1024x576.jpg" alt="Things you can do all day as homemaker" class="wp-image-643"></figure>



<ul><li>Make a small garden, have few vegetables</li><li>Cleaning/vacuuming the home</li><li>Prepare for a dog and a cat if you have any</li><li>Watch tv maybe some news</li><li>Check what need in the house and go do some shopping</li><li>Check up on your family during the day</li><li>Take care of kids</li><li>Go online, learn about cooking then prepare nice food for later</li><li>Wash dishes</li><li>Kiss your husband, make him happy in bed</li><li>Breastfeed if you have a newborn</li><li>Teach kids and play with them</li></ul>



<p>What you do a homemaker will depend on your style. Moms love different things so will you, but your responsibility is to make a husband happy.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Common housewife issues.</h2>



<p>Women tend to complain men put so much pressure on them. Forgetting wife is someone you love, not a machine. It gives women stress, sometimes that men expect them to do all the work, have kids, and later the man is looking for sex.</p>



<p>However, even though this all sounds reasonable. A woman always has a choice. It not like she is forced. It is a decision they make with her husband.</p>



<p>Homemaker is not independent as a career woman. There is a risk if her husband dies, she won&rsquo;t be able to provide for the kids. Her lack of a work history means that she can&rsquo;t get a job.</p>



<p>Another issue has to do with the husband losing the job. Now both are not working with kids to take off. Even if they don&rsquo;t have kids if they both home without the proper income it can be the issue.</p>



<p>Marriage, in the long run, can turn abusive. Some men can think because they give you money, they own you. So, they might expect you to be perfect all the time. Worse, you have to move out of your home so you are stuck with him.</p>



<p>Now, this does not mean don&rsquo;t be a housewife. But make sure you choose a good man that you have known for many years. Because it is a big decision.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Should you have a college degree as a housewife?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Should-you-have-college-degree-as-housewife-1024x576.jpg" alt="Should you have college degree as housewife" class="wp-image-645"></figure>



<p>Most definitely if you can get one. Even though you might never use your degree but it is there as security or insurance. A degree gives you a security to do what you need to do in unforeseen circumstances. Just in case things don&rsquo;t go as planned, you can start afresh and be independent.</p>



<p>Being educated also changes how you choose your lifestyle. Some degrees can be used at home. Maybe you end up starting a small business indoor.</p>



<p>No one can take your education from you. Maybe in the long run, if you have many kids. It can get hard for a husband to provide alone. You may need to work.</p>



<p>Education is for knowledge not only for job/salary but for your own development.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Develop good habits for yourself and your husband. Have a routine and be disciplined. Maintain your health, do the gym, look nice. Don&rsquo;t rely on domestic helpers, do most work yourself. It is your home, it needs your love and attention.</p>



<p>Go to church and love your kids.</p>

<p>We all have our own experience of cheating and being cheated on. But we sometimes get confused if we confront someone who cheated. Instead of them feeling sorry for what they did, they get angry on us.</p>



<p>Why is this and how to deal with it? Most of the time, if you cheat. You are aware of what will happen if you get caught. Most people will just break up with you if they catch you.</p>



<p>So, once a cheater realizes you know, they try to cover up with the lies. If they don&rsquo;t have the answer to your question that when they get mad and frustrated. Then try to overpower your questions with violent actions.&nbsp;So, you can stop asking them about their wrongdoings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-cheaters-get-angry-when-caught.jpg" alt="Why cheaters get angry when caught?" class="wp-image-625"></figure>



<p>Sometimes, they are not even angry. They act angry to be defensive. Defensiveness is often a good sign that someone has something to hide.</p>



<p>Most people don&rsquo;t want you to tell them they are wrong. They prefer you to leave them alone if you think they are wrong. If you continue to force answers on them. That pisses them off.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Should you forgive a cheater?</h2>



<p>Only forgive a cheating person if you still love them, and they are sorry. Understand if you are trying to leave someone who cheated, but you still love them. It will block you from loving the next person.</p>



<p>But if your partner cheats, and they don&rsquo;t ask forgiveness. They don&rsquo;t love and respect you enough, don&rsquo;t stay in that relationship. Move on a find someone who will value you. You may take a few months and stop dating. Give your self-time to heal and to be ready for the next relationship.</p>



<p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Don&rsquo;t start a new relationship with the anger from the past relationship.</span></p>



<p>If you still love them and planning to forgive them. You must understand, why did they cheat on you, because you may be the reason. If you are the reason. Sit down with them and talk about it. Come up with the solution.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Do cheaters always cheat again?</h2>



<p>Understanding if your partner will cheat again or not. Will depend on why he/she cheated. Was it because he/she felt negated or did he/she feel starving or seeking excitement, etc.</p>



<p>People cheat for different reasons. Understanding those reasons will give you a hint if they will cheat again.</p>



<p>Because someone is giving you the reason why he/she cheated. Does not mean what he/she did was right.</p>



<p>You must always talk about your problem in a relationship. If you can&rsquo;t find a solution. You must end the relationship and move on.</p>



<p>I can not give a single answer on whether a person will cheat on you. Because it defers from each relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Signs he/she might cheat again</h3>



<ul><li>No apology or say sorry, you can stop asking him/her questions.</li><li>A cheater doesn&rsquo;t want to listen to you. This is a sign he/she doesn&rsquo;t regret his/her action.</li><li>Cheated with more than one person.</li><li>If they cannot disclose why they cheated</li><li>Blame his action, not himself. Example (I was drunk)</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">How do you know a cheater is sorry?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-do-you-know-a-cheater-is-really-sorry.jpg" alt="How do you know a cheater is really sorry" class="wp-image-626"></figure>



<p>Now how do you know if a cheater is sorry? In case, you were thinking about forgiving him or her.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Distance yourself a minute and see if the cheater is coming after you. If they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t care about the relationship.</li><li>Did your partner break the relationship with the person he/she cheated with? Are they still communicating? If yes, then he/she does not feel sorry at all.</li><li>Your partner must adapt to your needs.</li><li>They won&rsquo;t pressure you to &ldquo;get over it&rdquo; before you&rsquo;re ready to do so.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">When wrongfully accused of cheating</h2>



<p>What if the reason for your partner to get angry, if you ask him/her about cheating, is because they didn&rsquo;t do it? That can happen when you think they did it, but they did not.</p>



<p>They have accused me of cheating several times. While I wasn&rsquo;t cheating and it is the worst feeling. People react differently, some can be furious if you call them cheaters. While they have been loyal to you.</p>



<p>In the worst case, you might not find out you were wrong. This can ruin a relationship if not end it. Make sure before you accuse your partner of cheating that you have proof. All your sources for accusation are solid.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">How does a guilty person act when accused?</h3>



<p>Now let us say you don&rsquo;t have enough proof to tell if they cheated or not. How they react will tell if they are guilty or not. </p>



<p>The most common sign is that they try to justify everything. They usually cannot answer your question and involve a lot of things under one question.</p>



<p>If you didn&rsquo;t do it, why would you even care that much about being in details? Not only they justify everything. But they get emotional too. They think you want to fight them, even if you were asking in a good-mannered.</p>



<p>After that, it becomes hard for them to sleep because they are guilty and still trying to come up with solutions. It like something is eating them.</p>



<p>They also avoid spending time with you and the eye contact. They might even ignore your call cause they fear you will ask them questions.</p>



<p>That how you know they are guilty and hiding something.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Cheating ruins a relationship</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cheating-ruins-a-relationship.jpg" alt="Cheating ruins a relationship" class="wp-image-627" width="720" height="405"></figure></div>



<p>Cheating is the worst thing you can do to someone you love. It&rsquo;s something you should never do, and it is very painful.</p>



<p>After you cheat on someone it changes the way they look at you. They don&rsquo;t trust you anymore, and they now see you as a lie. Can they recover from that? Yes, but it will take time, a very long time.</p>



<p>If you cheat, not only you disappoint your partner. But you disappoint everyone. Your family, your partner family, kids,&hellip;everyone. Because once you grow, we expect you to be responsible and do the right things.</p>



<p>Worse, it takes years to rebuild. So why cheat? Let not forget you stand a chance to lose a relationship. That would mean you wasted all those years building a relationship for nothing.</p>



<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t lose a relationship, you can still get STI. Now you and your partner are sick just because you couldn&rsquo;t be responsible.</p>



<p>Cheating ruin a relationship and it goes deeper than you think.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish you can someone who loves you and respects you the way you want. Who never even tries to cheat on you. Because you deserve better than that. Being in love is a blessing, and to be loved by someone <a href="http://What%20does%20it%20mean%20to%20love%20someone%20so%20much%20it%20hurts?">who never wants to lose you</a> is what we all fight for. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, distance can kill a relationship. Though you can talk every day over the phone. Lack of physical interaction can be a problem.&nbsp;Communicating can help, but does not solve all problems.</p>



<p>If you are in love with a person who validates physical interaction. The more time you spend apart, the more they will lose value. Walking hand in hand with your partner means a lot for some people, chatting all day doesn&rsquo;t do much for them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide1-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Can distance kill a relationship?" class="wp-image-599"></figure>



<p>If you miss your partner and say &ldquo;I wish I was there&rdquo; that can be a pleasant thing to say but not for long. If you say that over and over. Then it gets annoying!</p>



<p>Movies make long-distance looks so simple, but in actual life it complicated. Words need to be followed by actions. Words alone won&rsquo;t get far. Spending time with your partner is priceless.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Traveling cost</h2>



<p>Traveling costs also play a huge role in killing long-distance relationships. If you must pay high fees to visit someone every month. Over time, you realize you can cover a lot of things with that money.</p>



<p>My advice if you can pay high traveling fees just to see that one person. The best you can do is just move with them.</p>



<p>You will save money and all that long-distance drama.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Living without sex</h2>



<p>While one can stay without sex, the longer you stay without it. The more you will think your partner is doing it with someone else. The common issue with girls they like to accuse their boyfriends of cheating with 0 evidence.</p>



<p>Living without sex will also increase the chances of unnecessary fights. You can live without sex, but it won&rsquo;t be a happy life.</p>



<p>Sex is many things in a relationship. If you both cannot do sex because of the distance. This means you might lose the chance of having children in time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too far for my hands to hold you, but too near for my heart to love you.&rdquo;</span></p><cite>&ndash;&nbsp;Heraline</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Life changes</h2>



<p>Life has changed a lot over the years. Technology has changed the long-distance game. Even though you can use <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> or <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>, for video chat it&rsquo;s still nothing compared to a dinner and movie date.</p>



<p>Tech has given long-distance partners the chance to talk 24.7, while this sounds like a grand thing. But talking every day and meet once in a while actually might have a negative effect on relationships.</p>



<p>In a short-term technology can save a long-distance relationship, but in the long term, it does more harm than good.</p>



<p>It hard to maintain the long distance with or without technology.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Signs your long distance is dying</h2>



<p>Although we don&rsquo;t like long-distance. We can&rsquo;t run away from the fact someone is still involved. How can you see if your relationship is at risk?</p>



<p>This is important in long-distance because you might wait for someone who has moved on. If you see this sign, it can help to end a relationship before things get ugly.</p>



<ul><li>Every conversation is turning in to an argument.</li><li>Reducing communication time over the phone.</li><li>Delaying the dates for the visits.</li><li>When you meet your partner, it feels like you are with a stranger.</li><li>Losing hope in a relationship.</li><li>No one is willing to compromise.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&nbsp;<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">&ldquo;If you found that one person who is really worth the sacrifices, pain, and hardships, then your efforts will not go to waste.&rdquo; </span></p><cite>&ndash; Anna Agoncillo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Third option</h2>



<p>We know the most long-distance relationships won&rsquo;t work. For this reason, most people keep options open while in a relationship since most relationships often fail.</p>



<p>If your partner thinks he/she is attractive, they think about the third option. Then just long-distance relationship. The distance can work for a few months, but as your partner has the second or third option. The risk in your relationship grown big time.</p>



<p>Especially when time gets hard, people give up easily in long-distance. Then in just a normal relationship. Having a negative thought about the relationship is enough to kill the relationship.</p>



<p>But in long-distance confusion and fear of wasting your time can be the feelings that you can&rsquo;t run from.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">How do I keep a distance from ruining my relationship?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="How do I keep distance from ruining my relationship?" class="wp-image-601"></figure>



<p>Long-distance is very complicated and will need you both to be loyal, trust, and believe in each other. Most long-distance fail in a year or fast than that, however, some can make it work even though it difficult.</p>



<p>These are the thing that can help your relationship during long-distance</p>



<ul><li><strong>Get married </strong>people to respect the ring more, even when you are away.</li><li><strong>Send pictures, </strong>make it a habit to send pictures every time you take new ones. If you both have kids, also send pictures for kids too.</li><li><strong>Talk constantly, but not always. </strong>The mistake people do is to think just because there are on long-distance now, they must talk every day. Don&rsquo;t only talk when it makes sense.</li><li>If you are both in a long distance because of work. One of you must <strong>try to get a work transfer as soon as possible.</strong></li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t say things you can&rsquo;t say face to face over the phone.</strong> Respect your partner just because they are now far doesn&rsquo;t mean you must say bad things over the phone you can&rsquo;t tell in person.</li><li><strong>Send gifts and followers.</strong> Just because you far do not mean you can&rsquo;t send gifts home. Technology is very helpful if used the right way. You can even buy lunch using <a href="https://www.mrdfood.com/">MR D</a> or <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/za">UberEATS</a> for your partner while you are not around.</li><li><strong>See it as an opportunity. </strong>While you are in a distance, focus on self-development. You can start learning, get a driver&rsquo;s license, etc. Don&rsquo;t just sit and wait for your partner, develop yourself.</li><li><strong>Have rules. </strong>Most people skip this part, but it is necessary. For example, can one date while in the distance or can they use things like sex toys? You need to have rules and commit to them.</li><li><strong>Avoid dirty talk. </strong>Most people think because you are far now you must send nudes and talk dirty constantly. But doing that will make you wish for sex if you can&rsquo;t get it. That when frustrations kick in.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be selfish and careless</strong>. What do I mean by that? I mean going out with friends and late-night drinks. While your partner is not doing any of that and patiently waiting for you.</li><li><strong>Have a goal you both want to achieve.</strong></li><li><strong>You must know when the distance will end.</strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><strong> No relationship can stay on </strong>long-distance forever</span>. So, it must be clear when it is going to end.</li><li><strong>Know each other&rsquo;s schedules. </strong>This can be helpful because you will know when to call and not to.</li><li><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/how-do-you-express-love-to-your-family/"><strong>Spend more time with your family.</strong> </a>While your partner is away trying to be available to your family and his.</li><li><strong>Discuss how you deal with pressure</strong>. You both in a long-distance pressure will be there, discuss how you deal with it.</li><li><strong>Talk about big issues in person, avoid them over the phone</strong>.</li><li><strong>Visit often even when you don&rsquo;t have money. </strong>The other mistake people do is to think they only need to go home when they got paid. If you have money for transport, go home your company will mean more.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t ignore your instincts if you think something is wrong, pay attention.</strong></li></ul>

<p>How do you express your love to your family members? Do you give them a gift? Do you give them a back scratch? Do you tell them you really appreciated something they did? Do you schedule a special time in your day? </p>



<h2><strong>Love your parents</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide7-1024x576.jpg" alt="love your parent jpg" class="wp-image-579" width="206" height="115"></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Before you love anyone else in your family start with your parents. Respect them and give them love. No one in your family will love you if you are mean to your parents.</p>



<p>Develop a positive attitude toward your parents. They are the reason you even have a family. You may disagree with what your parents tell you from time to time.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p> </p>



<p></p>



<p>Please! <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">If you disagree with them, don&rsquo;t be rude about it.</span></strong></p>



<p>Spend time with them, even if you have your own place. Visit your parents and spend time with them.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Family comes first</span></h2>



<p>Most blessings we get depend on the relationship we have with our family&rsquo;s. If you are someone that believes in God like me. Before you ask anything on God do good for your family first.  You must always be reliable, don&rsquo;t make promises you can&rsquo;t keep. </p>



<p>The pleasant thing about the family, you don&rsquo;t have to pretend to be someone that you are not. They know you and they love you the way you are. </p>



<h2>Positive mental attitude</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-581" width="531" height="299"></figure></div>



<p>A lot of things will happen in our families. Always try to keep a positive mental attitude whenever you can. Embrace life even when you have obstacles. </p>



<p>Life becomes unfair and hard for all of us. But if you keep a positive attitude, your family will appreciate you even more. </p>



<p>Why you shouldn&rsquo;t have a negative mental attitude in your family? If you have a negative attitude, you think worse of everything.</p>



<p>Even if your family loves you, your mind can make you believe they don&rsquo;t. It also makes smaller problem to become bigger problems.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Take your kids out</span></h2>



<p>Kids love going out but they can&rsquo;t because we as parents are the only ones with that power to take them out. </p>



<p>It always nice to take your kids out to different places so they can explore. You can all go out as a family with your husband and kids. </p>



<p>Do lunch, maybe go to a mini-town because kids love mini-towns. </p>



<div class="wp-block-cover alignwide has-background-dim-20 has-background-dim has-custom-content-position is-position-bottom-left" style="background-image:url(https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-13.jpg);background-position:40% 26%;min-height:332px"><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="line-height:1.1;font-size:74px;color:#fffffa"><strong>Mini-town</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>But mini-town are not the only places kids enjoy. You can do your own research based on your location.</p>



<h2>Be there when your presence is required</h2>



<p>Sometimes your presence is enough. Families don&rsquo;t always require you to bring something. Just be there when they need you that enough. </p>



<p>Some family members choose to stay away, maybe because of unpleasant experiences which happened in the past. </p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Be loyal</span></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-573"></figure>



<p>Loyalty is everything home, work, and in a relationship.&nbsp; So, for your family to take you more seriously, you must stand for your words and avoid breaking promises.</p>



<p>You must be loyal to your family, which can also mean to be faithful. Try to provide them with what makes them happy. If you are lucky to have a job, you must put it in mind that you work for your family.</p>



<p>You must stand for your brother and sister and the entire family if they are in trouble. Give your family emotional support and improve your loyalty.</p>



<p>Loyalty is something which we teach ourselves, and over time we get better at it. Don&rsquo;t forget your family also needs spiritual support.</p>



<h2>Understand family moods</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-574" width="186" height="105"></figure></div>



<p>They will test your loyalty several times in your family. Family moods are very common and you need a plan to deal with them.</p>



<p>Some family member doesn&rsquo;t like to be told what to do and not to do. That way you might request them to do something for you and that when the moods kick in.</p>



<p>But they can be moody for several reasons, I&rsquo;m just making an example. Since moods are changed by a lot of things.</p>



<p>It wise to give your family members space if you see they are not in a good mood. Talk to them later, once they cool off. There is nothing wrong with bad moods. No one feels cheerful all the time. Just try not to make things worse.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Know what your family love</span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-575"></figure></div>



<p>Different families love uncommon things, some love music, fishing, braai day, some movies, etc. To express love to your family you must know what they love as the entire family and individuals.</p>



<p>You will also need to know the birth date for each member. This can help you with arranging a surprise party and buying gifts in time.</p>



<p>Holiday times like Christmas are hard if you don&rsquo;t know what your family likes.</p>



<h2>Help one another</h2>



<p>While every family can be different, most families depend on one another and help one another.</p>



<p>Families come in different sizes, your family might be big or small. However, if you want to express love to your family.</p>



<p>Teach them to help one another and be a leading example. What really makes a family is the love, care, and concern that members show for one another.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Be surprising</span></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide5-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-577"></figure>



<p>Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to do the same thing over and over. Learn new things. The family loves surprises. &nbsp;If you do pleasant things for them don&rsquo;t expect them to do the same. Just do things out of your go hearth.</p>



<p>Yes, some will return the favor but don&rsquo;t expect it from them.</p>



<h2>Buy Gifts</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide6-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-578" width="187" height="105"></figure></div>



<p>Gifts are the obvious and popular way to express love to your family.&nbsp; But not all of buying them. You need to learn the language of gifts. The fact we are not born with a giving nature or you were not given enough present growing up. Does not mean you must not buy a present for your family.</p>



<p>But don&rsquo;t give a gift for the wrong reasons. Wrong reasons can be to compete with other givers in your family or to earn a reputation as a giver.</p>



<p>Many people give in order to feed their egos. Which is not cool you must always buy a gift for the right reason. The major reason is to express love.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Conclusion</span></h2>



<p>Just express love to your family any way you can. Family is a gift on its own, appreciate that while you can. Your family needs your commitment and love. Show up if need and be there for each other, never give up on them.</p>



<p>Family is not only important but also everything. No family is perfect, every family spends time apart but makes time if needed. Forget about everything else, just go home, and love your family.</p>
