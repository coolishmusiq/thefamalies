<p>How to apologize to someone you offended and the power of apology. Saying I am sorry for hurting you can mean a lot to some people. But what I see is that it is very hard to apologize to a woman. Because even when you say forgive me, my love. They can hardly take that as a good apology and tell you to don&rsquo;t say it if you don&rsquo;t mean it. You think I have apologized, what more does she wants.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apologizing-1024x576.jpg" alt="apologizing" class="wp-image-815"></figure>



<p>Sometimes we don&rsquo;t even know how to apologize the proper way as men. Especially if dating, your partner will even tell you, to tell her, that you are sorry. But an apology is not something that you ask for, the person who did you wrong must always apologize. But not on your term because he must mean what he is saying. Not because you tell him to. </p>



<p>There are things you should never apologize for and there are things you should. It is your choice to beg for forgiveness. Women tell us when we upset them and we believe them. But do we apologize all the time, even when it was just a misunderstanding? <strong>Let talk about that.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">The do&rsquo;s and the don&rsquo;ts of apologizing</h2>



<p>The first thing we must understand when dating. You will never be loved 100% the way you want. I don&rsquo;t care if you have the richest man in the world or just a normal guy. Take out the thought people must be 100%. Because even you will be 100% in them.</p>



<p>What are the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of apology it a broad question. I am not an expert in apologizing and believe no one is an authority in apologizing. With apologizing will never be perfect. We all struggle in this, some do it more than they should. Some don&rsquo;t even know when to say it. Some don&rsquo;t even know how to react if you apologize to them.</p>



<p>The problem with most of us is when something happens. It is hard to accept that on me! Even though we are taught to say I&rsquo;m sorry. Most of us don&rsquo;t know how to say that well enough. So it means something to a person we are saying sorry to.</p>



<p>The apology is a gift and it tool that can be used to restore a relationship. More often to people we are close to. If you apologize to someone you say I care about you and I put the relationship first.</p>



<p>I care more about fixing your feeling than my pride.&nbsp; Apologizing is so difficult and it so humbling. Sometimes in saying I&rsquo;m sorry, you don&rsquo;t have the perfect words. You also fear saying wrong things which can make the situation worse.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to control such situations and sometimes. I just wish I can hide and don&rsquo;t apologize. Just forget anything ever happened and that not possible too.</p>



<p>But in this situation what helps is to think about the relationship. How much it means to you. How much you love that person and how much are you willing to keep it.</p>



<p>If you really care about them and you believe them. When they say you upset me. You have no choice, but to apologize. Even if you know you are not wrong. It not about you being right. But you saving your relationship. Also, you caring for that person.</p>



<p>You must admit you are not perfect. Even though that hard to admit to other people.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Thing we can do to apologize well</h3>



<ul><li>The first thing you must do when apologizing is to use I. if you are saying you are sorry you need to take the blame. You can&rsquo;t say you are sorry. But still blaming the person you want to forgiveness from. Women sometimes apologize to expose your bad behavior. Which is not a proper way to apologize to someone. Your apology must be about you, not the other person. Before apologizing it helps to sit down with yourself first. Understand why you need to apologize and how will you do it.</li><li>Find the right time to do it. You need to make sure the other person is in a state to listen. The perfect time to say I&rsquo;m sorry is immediately when it happens. But I understand sometimes it can take some time for us to realize no, this was wrong. The minute you realize, say you are sorry. Because the sooner the better. Because sometimes you can feel that you are not ready to apologize. Claim your self down and when you feel you can do it. Do it!</li><li>See it on the side of the other person. Because most of the time what makes it hard to apologize. We focus too much on what we think and forget about the other person. You may have a unique perspective. However, just because you have a different perspective. Really doesn&rsquo;t mean you are right based on their perspective.</li><li><strong>Sorry without a change is not enough.</strong> If you say I&rsquo;m sorry to someone. Your action must change afterward.&nbsp; If you are sorry, it means you will change your behavior. Otherwise, there is no need for you to apologize, if you won&rsquo;t change. Above I said the aim to apologize is to repair and if you don&rsquo;t change. You are still harming the relationship. Change is so important. Because if you did something. That oven yourself agrees it is wrong. Yet you are doing it again. It really brings attention to you as a person.</li></ul>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Things we don&rsquo;t do when apologizing</h3>



<ul><li>The first thing that I see all the time. When someone is trying to apologize they use but. <strong>Don&rsquo;t say But! </strong>Because when you say I&rsquo;m sorry but! Your but is the only thing that person receives. If you apologize to me. I like that and for a moment I think you care about my feeling. However, the minute you say <strong>but</strong> I forget everything you said.</li><li>Saying you are sorry. While you are busy doing the other things.&nbsp; This really doesn&rsquo;t count. If you apologize, you must pay attention to your words and be in that moment of apologizing.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t expect someone to forgive you. Just after saying you are sorry. Even if you know you said I&rsquo;m sorry respectfully.&nbsp; But the pleasant thing is that you did. It will also give you relief if they don&rsquo;t forgive you. They have a right to do so and that on them. Understand forgiveness is a process, and it happens over time.&nbsp; Some people need to see you change before they can accept your apology. Some accept it right away. I am one of those. If you say sorry to me, I forgive you immediately. If I don&rsquo;t forgive you now, I might never. But the rest is on me. What more important is that you came to me and humbled yourself.</li><li>Avoid apologizing using text. Try the phone call or in person. What I noticed about the text is that some people can read it wrong. You can say something and mean it. But the other person can read it and get the wrong viewpoint. Beside it more respectful to say in person or in a call. Rather than just text.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t have expectations of the other person. There are times in life where. Someone will deeply hurt you, and you sit there waiting for an apology that will never come. Sometimes you might get it. But it won&rsquo;t be the one you hoped for. So, it really helps to don&rsquo;t have high hopes with things like someone saying sorry to you. You can teach yourself to forgive people without them saying I&rsquo;m sorry. Because some don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry in words. But they do something nice for you to say sorry. You on the other hand sit there waiting for an apology. But they think they have apologized. You can not change some people the only person you can change is yourself.</li><li>Never apologize if you feel, you don&rsquo;t want too, and you are sure. You were not wrong. Instead, tell your partner. You understand what you did was wrong and you will do better next time. </li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">The power on apologizing</h2>



<p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Departments/Ombuds%20Office/files/M.Wagner.ColumbiaUniversity.OmbudsOffice.ThePowerofApologies.pdf">Harvard Medical</a> College made a study about the apology and the power behind forgiveness. People who are hurt or humiliated often wait for forgiveness. Why do we even need an apology?</p>



<ul><li>The first thing to be sure the same thing will never happens</li><li>To understand if something was done intentionally or not.</li><li>To repair our self</li><li>To earn respect</li><li>And to put that thing in the past</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nplinUox428?feature=oembed"></a></p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nplinUox428" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>This video explains how hard apologizing in men can be. But yet it is the most important thing for women. If you don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry. You build bridges with the person you are in a relationship with. You apology it the only thing that can fix things.</p>



<p>We sometimes think apologizing will make us look weak. But most of the time once you do it, it does the opposite effect. Most of the time in the relationship is wasted talking about the past. But this sometimes can be avoided. If we teach our self to say I&rsquo;m sorry when we are wrong. We can move on with our lives.</p>



<p><strong>Remember to say I&rsquo;m sorry and remember to say thank you. This will change your life.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Over apologizing</h2>



<p>We understand by now how important it is to say I&rsquo;m sorry. But do we really need to apologies all the time?  If we do what this says about us.</p>



<p>Once you teach yourself this, you can overdo it sometime. The problem with apologizing for everything. It creates this picture of you doing everything wrong. Just because you know you are going to say I&rsquo;m sorry. The more you say it, the more it feels unreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over apologizing can undermine you. It can also hurt your self-esteem, and no one is doing that to you. But you do that to yourself.</p>



<p>So, you need to find the balance. Don&rsquo;t overdo it, overdoing it doesn&rsquo;t always mean you say it over and over.</p>



<p>If you did something, and your partner is mad. All she need is your word that sincerely come from your heart. The roses can be nice. But once you start washing her car, calling her 300times, telling everyone to talk to her, showing up at her work, etc.</p>



<p>You are overdoing it and that not what she wants. That might frustrate her even more.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">When the apology is not accepted</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Apology-not-accepted-1024x576.jpg" alt="Apology not accepted" class="wp-image-817"></figure>



<p>When we say I&rsquo;m sorry, it doesn&rsquo;t always go as planned. Sometimes it can backfire hard and not always right away. It can backfire when you said you are sorry and then you went through and did the same thing all over again.</p>



<p>Sometimes your partner will be mad at you. But with no sufficient proof. Then you ask for forgiveness and it proves to her you did it. Which gets her even crazier.</p>



<p>They can use your sorry against you.</p>



<p>We don&rsquo;t like to request for forgiveness and find that they do not accept our forgiveness. But that does and will happen. There are things you can do if your admission of guilt is not accepted. Thich can help or stop the situation from getting worse.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>You must never take your apology back. Which you can take by your reactions. Because if you say I&rsquo;m sorry, you do it for the right reasons. If they reject you that on them.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be defensive or try to remind them how many times time they have been wrong, and you have forgiven them. It not about them this time, but you.</li><li>Give them space so they can process it.</li><li>Show your apology with your actions</li><li>Re-try visit some other time. Remind them you meant what you said and you are still sorry.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Exchange of apologies</h2>



<p>Sometimes your partner is wrong 50% and you also wrong in a way. But you must apologize to fix your partner and your partner need to apologize to you.</p>



<p>An outstanding example of this is when you did something wrong. Then your partner says hateful things to you just because you are wrong. After you apologize and your partner forgives you. The questions come flying in your head. If your partner really meant what she said to you.</p>



<p>Now even though the problem was about you. But they also need to apologize to you. So, you can heal too. Because what they said to you is very hurtful and you can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What usually helps me so I don&rsquo;t say hurtful things in the other person. I look into myself first and have respect for myself. Me respecting myself means I can say no, you can&rsquo;t say such things to others. Even if want to say it and it in my head. But I don&rsquo;t say it. Because I respect them more importantly, I respect me!</p>



<p>Exchanging apologies is great. Because in the end it not about you. If you made that person feel humiliated you own him too. Every time someone says I&rsquo;m sorry. It doesn&rsquo;t end there, you need to think about how you reacted to them.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t get defensive about it or make a justification. The reason you did wrong is that of what they did. NO, You had many ways to handle the situation, but you have chosen to be hurtful.</p>



<p>It is common for people who always expect people to apologize, to don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry too. Or if they do say there are sorry, they include but you have. Or say I am only apologizing because&hellip;..</p>



<p>Thich is total wrong and don&rsquo;t qualify as a proper apology.</p>



<p>The other thing which you must know about exchanging apologies. which I might have talked about early. If you say I&rsquo;m sorry that doesn&rsquo;t mean it fixes everything right away. So, they might not apologize back right away. It can take a few hours sometimes even longer than that.</p>
