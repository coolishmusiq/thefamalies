<p>Once you become an Ex, a lot of drama and confusion is involved. Should you block him? Should you continue supporting him? If I do what this means?</p>



<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to help you deal with your ex the right way. Also, answer the question like. How do you know when it over? Do you still love your ex or you are just lonely?</p>



<p>There are many reasons you think about your ex.&nbsp; You might miss those late-night talk and if you haven&rsquo;t found a new partner. You will miss your ex the most. Thinking about your ex doesn&rsquo;t mean you must get back together. Sometimes you must move on. Because <strong>going back might hurt you even more.</strong></p>



<p>Accepting the relationship is over can be hard and the longer it takes, the harder it gets. After getting a new partner, it gets better. The thoughts of your ex will never be permanently forgotten. However, you will feel better after a few years. It like the death of someone we love. It gets hard, at the 1<sup>st</sup> until we learn to leave without them.</p>



<p>If you think about your ex. Yet you don&rsquo;t think they deserve a second chance. It helps to spend more time with family and friends. Until you find someone.</p>



<p>Failing to find a new relationship will make you think about your ex even more. Don&rsquo;t be stuck in your past, because it would be all you see. You can still find someone new. That will value and respect you.</p>



<p>There is a reason your last relationship ended. Don&rsquo;t forget about those reasons. History always repeats itself, if we keep going back to your past.</p>



<p>If we are in a relationship, we follow certain patterns. Sometimes we miss things we did with our exes, not necessarily them.&nbsp; If you are lucky to find someone new, who will teach you new patterns. That when we forget the old ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missing your ex means you are lonely, and you haven&rsquo;t found a new life. Which will close the gap for your old life.</p>



<p>It is hard to understand. If you miss your ex or just having someone to spend quality time with. Or you just miss sex.</p>



<p>However, it also possible you are still in love with your ex. If you made a quick decision without thinking it through. Sometimes we end relationships just to avoid solving problems.</p>



<p>If that the case, your mind knows you ended the relationship without good reasoning. Your relationship can still work, you just need to put pride aside and solve your problems.</p>



<p>But there must never be a day when you try so hard to get your ex back. Doing this will give your ex more power and they might take you for granted. Even when you are truly in love with your ex. Wait until they prove they still have the attention in a relationship.</p>



<h2>What do you do if you still like your ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/still-like-your-ex.jpg" alt="still like your ex" class="wp-image-881"></figure>



<p>Some relationships can end while you are still in love. If this happens, it can be hard to move on. Not because you cannot move on. You don&rsquo;t want to move on. Maybe you still wish your ex can come back and apologize.</p>



<p>This can make you feel stuck in your past relationship. The worse thing that can happen, your ex might never apologize. If you still love you ex, yet no chance of a rebound. You must first accept it over. If you don&rsquo;t accept it ended. You won&rsquo;t think about what to do next.</p>



<p>You will keep thinking about what if you did things differently. Maybe the outcome would be different. Which is true, but you didn&rsquo;t accept it. It takes two people to be in a relationship. If one is no longer be part of it, then it no longer a relationship.</p>



<p>The only time I can advise you to go after your ex, is when your ex haven&rsquo;t moved on too. They are not involved in a new relationship and they are still in contact you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But going after your ex when they have moved on. Can put you in a very painful position. You can also talk to your friends and family members. People who knew your relationship very well. Ask for advice on what to do. If they know the relationship is not good for you, they will tell you.</p>



<p>Loving yourself and opening up to a new life. Will help you move your focus away from your ex. Make your breakup the opportunity to do new things. You couldn&rsquo;t do it in a relationship.</p>



<p>When the breakup is still new. You will think about all the bad things about your ex. When time goes by you think about the wonderful memories. That when you will miss your ex the more. But just because you are thinking about the good times. Doesn&rsquo;t mean your partner is good for you.</p>



<p>Going back to your ex just because you have the old wonderful memories. Does not mean all those good things will happen again if you get back together.</p>



<h2>Why do exes contact you out of the blue?</h2>



<p>Should I call back my ex? Your ex can contact you for different reasons. The best way to understand is to talk to them. Even though you can ignore him/her. Maybe you want peace in your life.</p>



<p>Some exes are lonely and want to have a conversation. Sometimes when they go through a hard time. They want support from you. Especially if they haven&rsquo;t found a new partner to replace you.</p>



<p>It is totally up to you to answer or call back your ex. If you still have feeling and the reason for a breakup are not that bad. Why not! But if you feel they don&rsquo;t deserve your time, then don&rsquo;t give them attention.</p>



<h2>Does dreaming of an ex mean they miss you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dreaming-of-your.jpg" alt="dreaming of your ex" class="wp-image-876"></figure>



<p>Dreaming about your ex will make you question yourself. Do I still love my ex? If you have a new relationship. It will feel you are betraying your new partner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex can mean two things. You miss your ex or your ex misses you. Most cases if you thought about your ex before you went to sleep. There is a high chance you might dream of your ex that night.</p>



<p>If your ex thinks or talks about you. The universe can hear that and talk to you back with a dream.&nbsp; This is why we dream about most recent events more often.</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex giving you advice. Your mind is telling not to repeat same mistakes you did with your ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dreaming of your ex death doesn&rsquo;t mean your ex is dying. But your feelings for the old relationship are dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h2>Can exes fall back in love?</h2>



<p>Yes, your ex can fall back in love with you and it happens more than you might think.</p>



<p>If they lost no dignity in your breakup. It is still possible to get back together and still possible your ex misses you too.</p>



<p>This will also depend on the age of your relationship. If you and your ex have a lot of history together. It won&rsquo;t be easy to move on for any of you.</p>



<p>But <strong>your relationship ended for a reason don&rsquo;t forget</strong>. If your relationship with your ex was in an excellent position or healthy. It wouldn&rsquo;t have ended in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Before you make your ex fall back in love. You must think of every problem you were having in your relationship. Think if they can be solvable or not. If your relationship had serious problems like <strong>cheating and abuse</strong>. Forget about that relationship, <strong>just forget</strong>.</p>



<p>But if your ex was bringing value in your life. Yet, you didn&rsquo;t realize how much your ex was helping you. Now that your relationship is over. Your life is not complete anymore.</p>



<p>Think of everything you did which made you ex to fall out. Fix your self 1<sup>st</sup> before you go back to apologize. The only way to make your ex fall back. Will begin by you admitting all your mistakes and making sure you don&rsquo;t repeat them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exes often come back but don&rsquo;t wait for your ex. They might not come back.</p>



<h2>How do you know if an ex misses you?</h2>



<p>How do you know if your ex secretly misses you? Most of us will use a breakup as a time to heal. Once we heal, we may miss our old relationship.</p>



<p>But even when we miss our exes, sometimes pride can kick in. We wait for them to miss us too.</p>



<h3>If one of these things happens. Then your ex could be missing you.</h3>



<ul><li>If your ex blocked you on a breakup and recently unblocked you.</li><li>If your ex finds random excuses to contact you.</li><li>Start asking about you in your friends and family.</li><li>Call you or text you when they are drunk.</li><li>Start stalking you on social media.</li><li>Your ex is always happy to see you.</li><li>Remembers your birthdays.</li><li>Give your kids some money.</li></ul>



<p>These can be clues that your ex is missing you. But do you miss your ex? Your ex can miss you, yet if you have moved on. Don&rsquo;t go back.</p>



<h2>Do exes come back after months?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/exes-ccome-back-after-months.jpg" alt="exes ccome back after months" class="wp-image-878"></figure>



<p>Most of the time they will. Removing someone in your mind is difficult. Some forget after a few months, for some, it gets harder. &nbsp;Sometimes we have 0 control of our memories.</p>



<p>Most of the time your ex will come back after seeing you dating someone else. Seeing you with someone else can make your ex jealous.&nbsp; If you are in a new relationship. They feel like someone is winning something that belongs to them.</p>



<p>But if your ex date someone else quickly after a breakup. They might not come back. The only time they will come back is when. This new relationship they started is not what they hoped for.</p>



<p>If they also celebrated the breakup publicly. Even when they miss you, the chances of them coming back are too small.</p>



<p>Sometimes your ex will get back to you, just to prove a point. Or if you used to support your ex. They might miss you when they face tough times.</p>



<p>If your ex comes back after months. It can be a good thing or he/she is coming back with more problems.</p>



<h2>Should you keep supporting your ex?</h2>



<p>Stop supporting your ex after a breakup. Just stop! If you are no longer in a relationship. That person is no longer your responsibility.</p>



<p>Whether you support your ex emotional or financial. It is not your place to do that. Let your ex go, <strong>either they are with you or they are not.</strong></p>



<p>Stop trying to make yourself look important. You are just forcing yourself in a place you don&rsquo;t belong to.</p>



<p>Even if your ex is the one coming back for support. Keep in mind, they deserve nothing. They left you!</p>



<h2>Does silence make an ex miss you?</h2>



<p>Silence can make a man miss you. But not all men!</p>



<p>Silence can also make a man move on, from his past relationship.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, silence can work but there are no guarantees. <strong>A lot can happen while you are silent</strong>. You also have no right to blame him, since you went silent.</p>



<p>But it always a good idea to lay low sometimes. This helps you avoid saying things you don&rsquo;t mean. Just go silent make your ex wonder why you don&rsquo;t give them attention anymore. Have you found someone or you really don&rsquo;t have a feeling for them anymore?</p>



<p>Silence will make your exes realize your absence and start missing. But this can also trigger him to look for a new partner. Since your exes are now feeling lonely.</p>



<p>You can cut a guy off and let him miss you. Don&rsquo;t give him too much space though if you still love him. Because he will develop new patterns without you.</p>



<p>If you want to stop talking to your ex. So, your ex can miss you, know it does not end there. You still need to do more to make sure your plan works. Try this</p>



<ul><li>Keep in contact with your ex family members. Even though you don&rsquo;t talk to your ex.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t block your ex on social media. Make your ex see everything you are up too.</li><li>Invest in yourself, go out, and have fun.</li></ul>



<p>These can help if you want your ex to miss you. Yet you don&rsquo;t want to talk to him yet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Can you stay a friend with an ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/staying-friends-with-an-ex.jpg" alt="staying friends with an ex" class="wp-image-880"></figure>



<p>People ask this question a lot. The reason they want to stay friends with their ex. They still care about them and enjoy their company.</p>



<p>If you also feel this way, I have a question for you. <strong>If you still enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, why did you break up?</strong></p>



<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you both fix your problem instead of breaking up?</p>



<p>Because if you breakup with someone. It means you want nothing to do with them. But this is not a simple question to answer. I think it can really depend on you and what you want.</p>



<p>Someone who cheated on you, can not expect you to be friends with them after a breakup. However, if the breakup was just a small miss understanding. It&rsquo;s understandable to remain friends. It still depends on how big are your problems and can they be fixed.</p>



<p>But if you or your ex have new partners. Staying friends is a no go!</p>



<p>Since the relationship end for a reason. Staying a friend with your ex can also take away your time to heal. It is also a disrespect to your new relationship.</p>



<h2>Why do guys act like they don&rsquo;t care after a breakup?</h2>



<p><strong>Sometimes they are not acting, they really don&rsquo;t care</strong>. If you care about someone you do everything to keep them. If you still act like you don&rsquo;t care about a breakup. Then you didn&rsquo;t deserve that relationship in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Stop following your ex if you see they don&rsquo;t care after a breakup. Move back and force on you.</p>



<p>Once someone becomes your ex, they need not explain themselves to you. Because you are no longer together. <strong>That why they say what yours will always come to you.</strong></p>



<p>If your ex doesn&rsquo;t come back after a breakup. The relationship was never yours. Move on, you will find someone new. There is no person who is better than everyone. You can always find someone who is better than your ex. Don&rsquo;t be stuck with people who treat you like you mean nothing to them.</p>



<h2>Reason to take a break after a breakup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/healing-after-a-breakup.jpg" alt="healing after a breakup" class="wp-image-879"></figure>



<p>There are many reasons you should heal. After a failed relationship. Many of us jump into the next relationship. With hope, it will heal the past relationship. However, in most cases, it doesn&rsquo;t. taking a break can be good for your mental health.</p>



<p>Jumping to the next relationship can replace pain with happiness. But it won&rsquo;t heal you, once your new relationship slows down. You will feel more pain. You might even regret your decision. Going back is no longer a wise choice.</p>



<p>If your new relationship fails. You are now facing pain for two relationship. Which both didn&rsquo;t work.</p>



<p>Not allowing yourself to heal can create a lot of problems. <strong>Like trust issues, anger, insecurities, etc</strong>.</p>



<p>Moving on without healing can negatively affect your emotions and the way you think.</p>



<p>Breakups can be a trauma no matter what side you are on.</p>



<h3>Recovering after a breakup</h3>



<p>Some break up can be bad. But you need to pick yourself up and move on. Your life doesn&rsquo;t end in a breakup, there is still a lot you can accomplish.</p>



<p>Recovering also mean you finding the right partner the next time. Not repeating the same patterns of bad partners.</p>



<ul><li>In the first step, focus on helping yourself. Getting professional help if you feel your need one, talking to your family members. Talking to your friends asking them what to do in your situation. Reaching out to people who recently recovered from relationship fail, and more. You know who are your good friends and best family members are. Because not everyone knows you and understands you.</li><li>Teach yourself that it is okay to feel pain after a breakup. The pain is not permanent, and it is not the end of your world. You are in control and you have the power to take yourself out of that pain.</li><li>Take some time and point out what did you do wrong. So, you can start learning from your mistakes and avoid them as early as possible in your next relationship. Learn what made you pick this person and what was good about him. What was bad about him or what was bad about you both in your past relationship? Makes sure you get all the fact right before you start a new relationship. I cannot guarantee your next relationship will work out. But you will avoid most problems from your previous relationship.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t contact each other unless there are kids involved. But if you don&rsquo;t have kids with your ex. There is no need to follow your ex on social media or keeping in touch. Because you will be starting noticing things your ex is doing right. Which can make you fall in love and forget why you guy broke up in the first place.&nbsp;</li><li>The experiment has fun and put yourself out there. Try new things, try a new life. Make yourself available not only to a new partner. But new friends also. Everything new can be exciting, which can help you heal faster. The more you try new things, the faster you will move away from your past.</li><li>Regain confidence and trust in yourself. Just believe you can gain anything that you want. You need not settle for less and keep going back to people who hurt you. Trust yourself you can move on and get everything that you want. It is a process but when you know what you want. Eventual it will come to you.</li><li>Maintain your dignity after a breakup. Don&rsquo;t be a person who keeps begging for a relationship. No need to always try to fix your relationship. Especially if you see your partner don&rsquo;t care anymore. If someone makes up their decision that they no longer want to be in a relationship with you. Stop fighting it and accept their decision. Begging to make you look desperate, which makes your partner lose attraction even more. You are going to be okay regardless of what is happening in your life.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>How do you tell she&rsquo;s not over her ex?</h2>



<p>Dating someone who is not over his ex is painful. But how can you tell if your new girlfriend is not over her ex?</p>



<h3>These can be signs she is not over her ex.</h3>



<ul><li>She keeps making excuses to visit you.</li><li>She talks about her past relationship a lot.</li><li>She still keeps in contact with her ex.</li><li>She gets angry at you for no reason.</li><li>Never enjoy sex with you.</li><li>Always treating you, she will leave the relationship.</li><li>She doesn&rsquo;t want to meet your family.</li></ul>



<h2>Should you take back an ex who dumped you?</h2>



<p>If you still love them you can, but if you have moved on don&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>Because this means whatever they thought they were doing didn&rsquo;t work. Now they are coming back to you as a backup plane.</p>



<p>You need someone who will be full committed to you.</p>



<p>Not someone who will come and go when it suits him/her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Who hurts more after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Women are more sensitive than man. They also sacrifice a lot in a relationship then most men. They even sacrifice their family just to be with you.</p>



<p>Very few men can move out of their home just to be with a woman.</p>



<p>If a woman enters a relationship. They enter with everything they have.</p>



<p>If the relationship doesn&rsquo;t work, it is safe to say. Women will hurt the most.</p>



<h2>Who moves on faster after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Man can move on before a breakup. By the time the relationship gets in to a break up they are long gone. Sometimes by the time they end the relationship. They are already involved a new one.</p>



<p>While women on the other hand. Needs some time to heal after a break. It can take them a very long time to heal.&nbsp; Sometimes it even takes years for a woman to move on.</p>



<p>The only time man will have a hard time moving on after a breakup. Will only be a time where he fails to find a better partner. Which will replace the old one.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, even though men move on faster. This does not mean they don&rsquo;t miss you, or they are not hurting over the past relationship. They do but they don&rsquo;t allow the pain to control them.</p>



<h2>Why people get stuck after breakup?</h2>



<p>People sometime get stuck with they ex. Even though they know the relationship was not good for them.</p>



<h3>These can be the reasons they are stuck.</h3>



<ul><li>They get in denial, they know relationship was not good for them. Yet they keep think it can be fixed. But they failed to fix it.</li><li>Thinking their happiness belong to their ex-partner. That without their ex, they can&rsquo;t have a good time.</li><li>Hold on to the old promises.</li><li>Focusing too much on the great time they both shared. Not willing to try new things.</li><li>Busy asking themselves why me, instead of asking. What did I learn from this?</li><li>Comparing their life to someone else&rsquo;s life.</li><li>Staying in contact with their ex.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Most of my advice are based on my past experience. However, how you treat your ex is total up to you.</p>



<p>But if your keep making the wrong decisions there will be consequence. Those results can make you hurt repeatedly.</p>



<p>If you find yourself hurting by a same person repeatedly. This means you must look back into your decisions. Try to understand what role are you playing. How can you get yourself out?</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t allow more pain in your life. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, try new things that works. Stop trying things that can&rsquo;t be fixed and love yourself. Because you deserve all the good things like everyone else.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mistake we do as parents is to think we can be perfect parent. When there is no such thing as perfect parenting. Because you are older, doesn&rsquo;t mean you are always right. Some days you will say wrong things to your kids or be hash. Nothing wrong with going back to your kids and apologize.&nbsp; You must never have the pride to apologise. Not only with your kids, but in life. </p>



<p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apologizing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to apologise and when.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Slide1-1024x576.jpg" alt="parents worst mistakes" class="wp-image-863"></figure>



<p>Every parent makes mistakes, and every kid makes mistakes. You will make mistakes there is no way to prevent them. You can only reduce and cut your mistakes. But you can&rsquo;t prevent them.</p>



<p>Beliefs we have can make us parent the wrong way. We must be open to learning new things and changed as the world change. Trying to raise your kids the same way you grew up won&rsquo;t work. If your parents punished you a lot as a kid. Which made a powerful man. Don&rsquo;t think it is wise to raise your kids that way. Beliefs are what will make us do most mistakes.</p>



<p>If you have a certain style of parenting and you see it not working. Do not force it, learn something else. Notice everything that is not working. Drop your ego, understand there is so much you don&rsquo;t know.</p>



<p>let look at what are the worst mistakes parents can make.</p>



<h2>Not choosing your words wisely.</h2>



<p>Words are powerful, and they can build or destroy. You must be careful about what you say to your children. My mom passed away when I was very young, and there are things my stepmother said to me. When I was 9 years old, about my bio mother. Which I carry to this day. Because they were mean things to say to a child. </p>



<p>Words as parents sometimes can come out the wrong way. Words have a deep meaning. They can heal and be weapons.</p>



<h2>Talking too much with your kids.</h2>



<p>Avoid talking too much with your kids. Say things you want to say and give them time to process everything. If you spend 30 minutes talking to your kids. They won&rsquo;t remember everything, only the thing which makes sense to them. You don&rsquo;t have to say the same things over and over for kids to understand you. If you do that it feels like abuse they heard the 1<sup>st</sup> time. Yet you still repeating it over and over.</p>



<p><strong>.Less is more!</strong> The worst mistakes parents make when talking to kids. Not paying attention to a kid&rsquo;s needs.  </p>



<h2>Not realizing how expensive babies can be.</h2>



<p>You are going to be the one carrying for your baby. Know your financial status and understand if you are ready. If you have over one kid. They can get too expensive and if you have no plan. You will experience problems. You might even be angry at kids for destroying your budget. While it is you who had no birth plan.</p>



<p>With babies, we don&rsquo;t know exactly when are they coming. But we need to save as early as possible. So, when that day comes, we are ready. It is difficult to save after you have a baby. It much easier if you save before you have a child.</p>



<h2>Neglecting kids&rsquo; hunger</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="hunger" class="wp-image-864"></figure>



<p>You can&rsquo;t expect your kids to be at their best while their tummy is empty. Hunger makes it hard to concentrate and can escalate misbehaving. Even us as parents we are likely to be impatient when we are hungry.&nbsp; Parents sometimes force kids to go out and play with other kids. Therefore, they can avoid making food for them. If you do that stop it now, it is not good for your child.</p>



<p>It your job to make sure your kids eat at all times. If their appetite drop take that seriously. </p>



<h2>Giving  your kids Alcohol</h2>



<p>Parents have a tendency of making kids taste alcohol. When a child start acts odd. they think it hilarious and take videos to post on social media. The following tweet is the great example of bad parenting. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have watched this 35 times <a href="https://t.co/QNusyBCYG0">pic.twitter.com/QNusyBCYG0</a></p>&mdash; Rupert Myers (@RupertMyers) <a href="https://twitter.com/RupertMyers/status/1315998224193331200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>You must choose your kids over alcohol. If you allow your kids to taste alcohol. You are the worst parent and they must arrest you. The drinking age is 18 years old here in South Africa, and in some parts of the world, it is 21 years old. There is a reason for this. </p>



<p>I see this a lot, even in my family. I never understand. How can you do such a thing to your child? What lessons are you giving them? I just don&rsquo;t get it! </p>



<p>There is a lot you can do with your kids. Things like <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/helping-your-children-learn-to-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping them learn to share</a>. Instead of giving them alcohol.</p>



<h2>Shouting at your kids</h2>



<p>You must avoid freaking out for your kids. Shouting undermines your ability to get your words through. They either shut down or get mad in response to your shouting. Shouting at your kids also makes them feel you hate them. They also feel like the worst kids and hate themselves. <strong>Avoid shouting!</strong></p>



<p>Try to talk some sense with them without rising your voice. </p>



<h2>Blocking your kids from technology</h2>



<p>There is a debate about smartphones and laptops. Parents have a fear of buying smartphones for their children. They might play games all the time and stop doing school work. Or watch unsuitable content for their age and more. <strong>This is all true!</strong></p>



<p>But let stop focusing on what can go wrong. Think about what technology can bring to your child. How I usually do this, when I&rsquo;m thinking about buying a smartphone for my child. Yet, I&rsquo;m worried they might use it the wrong way.</p>



<p>First, I buy a new phone and give a child the old one. When I give my child the old one, I never tell them it theirs. &ldquo;This is my old phone, you can use it. Because I have a new one. But if I see this phone is making you lose focus on important things like school. I will take it away.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While I know the phone is no longer mine. Yet I don&rsquo;t let the kid know that. So, they can give it some respect.</p>



<p>Same thing with laptops. I never give them 100% ownership. But the worst thing you can do is to block your children from using technology. I try to teach my kids everything that can help them be independent. Like how to invest in the stock market. Blogging and everything that they can start as a hobby. But in a log run generate good income.&nbsp; Would it be nice to see your kids making their 1st $1000 at 16? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great?</p>



<h2>Shaming your kids</h2>



<p>Shaming kids is another worst mistake parent do. If your child did something wrong. There is no need to compare your child with the one that is doing great. By doing this, and it will make your kids hate one another. Because you make them think. The other one is bad, and the other is the best. Parents also expect kids to do things the way their parents taught them. If they fail, then they see them as losers. <strong>Stop shaming your kids, it is wrong. </strong>Give them time to make mistakes and learn their own mistake.</p>



<p>The following video help us with ways we unknowingly shame our children.</p>



<iframe width="660" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R7B0Wi-kImg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<h2>Parents fighting with kids</h2>



<p>We see this almost everywhere. When after parents broke up, they fighting using kids. Kids have nothing to do with our breakups. Kids deserve both parents, even when those parents are no longer together. A child must have a relationship with both parents.</p>



<p>I experienced this a lot with my 1<sup>st</sup> child&rsquo;s mother. She would try to get back to me and if that didn&rsquo;t work out. She would cut me out completely, to a point where it would be impossible to contact both. That was painful to me, and I&rsquo;m sure it was for my daughter.</p>



<p>Parents need to stop involving kids in their personal problems. <strong>Love your children more than you dislike each other.</strong></p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake to not be the part of your child growing up.</p>



<h2>Be a leading example to your kids</h2>



<p>I think I have talked about this before in one of my posts. How kids can be copycats. You need to be a leading example in everything you want them to be. If you want them to treat everyone with respect. You must be the one treating your family with respect first. Kids learn more when they watch you doing something. Then when they listen to you talking about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want more kindness in the world, put some there.</p>



<h2>Not teaching your kids boundaries</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Slide3-1024x576.jpg" alt="kids boundaries" class="wp-image-865"></figure>



<p>Families must have boundaries and kids too. You must train children to do a certain thing and to act in certain ways. Example, your kids must knock every time they enter your bedroom. If you don&rsquo;t teach them this as early as possible. One day they will see things you don&rsquo;t want them to see and they will humble you.</p>



<p>Setting restrictions teach our kids to respect and know their limits.</p>



<h2>Never be your child&rsquo;s best friend</h2>



<p>Kids need to understand you are not a friend. But a parent, if they have problems. They must come to you. If you have problems, you won&rsquo;t come to them, but their father. It is very rare that you will tell them your secrets. However, it is not okay for them to keep a secret from you. They are not allowed to use your things without your person.</p>



<p>Long story short, we can be close. But not too close to a point where there are no boundaries.</p>



<h2>Expecting your child to fulfill your dreams</h2>



<p>We all have things we wanted to do growing up. Which we didn&rsquo;t, no need to force our kids to do things we failed to do ourselves. You can try to teach them if you feel is important and can help them. However, if you see, they are not into it. Don&rsquo;t force them, let them pick their own system of life.</p>

<p>Talk about family problems you can expect in any marriage. Every family has problems and we can never run away from it. If you believe your family won&rsquo;t have problems. You are just setting yourself for a disaster. Because you won&rsquo;t know how to act. When you reach that point in life.</p>



<p>If your family doesn&rsquo;t have problems it because you are the problem and they haven&rsquo;t told you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/marriage-is-not-easy-1024x576.jpg" alt="marriage is not easy" class="wp-image-856"></figure>



<ul><li>Either you are going to be a problem</li><li>You are going to marry a problem</li><li>Either you are going to marry a family with problems</li><li>Or you will have problems entering your marriage from the outside</li><li>Either your family is the problem&nbsp;</li><li>Or the combination of them all</li></ul>



<p>&ldquo;Marriage will show you how selfish you are, and parenting will show you how angry you are.&rdquo; That true and common in marriages.</p>



<p>Children are growing and still have lots of mistakes to make. Parents want them to act right all the time.</p>



<p>The wife is raised by a different family and the husband. There are days where they won&rsquo;t see eye to eye. Some days one will be selfish and the other will have pride.</p>



<p>If pride enters a marriage. Your spouse won&rsquo;t care if his/her beliefs are wrong or right. They know what they want and will try to convince you to do things their way.</p>



<p>Some days you will wish they can do things in a certain way. But no one will care about you.</p>



<p>We need to be aware all these struggles will happen. How you all deal with those problems. Will determine if your marriage will work or fail. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no such thing as a perfect marriage. Only families with better problem-solving skills.</p>



<p>If they do things your way all the time. You are selfish, maybe your partner won&rsquo;t tell you. But that selfishness and not the right way to treat your family.</p>



<p>Both partners must have a voice and play a part in how we arrive in conclusions. You must include your partner in your decisions. You must talk it through and come out with what seems to be a win for both of you.</p>



<h2>Why it so hard to forgive your spouse</h2>



<p>If your spouse upsets or lets you down. It is difficult to forgive. If you forgive someone, it means you understand what they did to you. But you will no longer hold it against them.</p>



<p>This process is not as easy as it sounds. Your spouse must help you in forgiving him or her. If they are not sorry for what they did or defensive about it. Forgiving become very hard.</p>



<p>It gets easy to forgive your spouse. If they sit down with you and talk about the problem. Telling you they understand what they did was wrong. They are sorry and it won&rsquo;t happen again. They completely understand there is nothing they can do to make this right. Except for saying sorry and they feel bad while take a responsibility for it. <strong>Last, they feel bad that it hurt you.</strong></p>



<p>That helping your spouse forgive you and it make it easy. Once your spouse understands that you know what you did was wrong. They can forgive you and let go.</p>



<p>What will make this hard is when your spouse says &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do something wrong, what your problem? Just get over it&rdquo;. This makes you even more upset because they did something wrong and they are not sorry about it.</p>



<p>Your spouse is not taking responsibility and they make you sound crazy for even talking about it. This makes it hard for a marriage to be healthy and moving forward.</p>



<p>This becomes a problem if your spouse hurts you over and over. Without being sorry because it keeps adding up. Even if they always come around and ask for forgiveness. It raises a question if you love me the way you say you do. Why do you hurt me in the 1st place? It&rsquo;s hard to forgive someone who constantly hurt you.</p>



<p>So, until there is a change in their behavior it never easy.</p>



<h2>Cheating in marriages</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/affairs-in-yourr-marriage-1024x576.jpg" alt="affairs in your marriage" class="wp-image-855"></figure>



<p>Cheating is the worst issue in marriage and it is hard to recover from it.&nbsp; We see it happening more and more these days. If someone cheats, they can&rsquo;t blame anything or anyone. Rather than blaming themselves.</p>



<p>What disturbing there is no way to make a relationship be 100% affair-proof. You can do everything right but that doesn&rsquo;t make you safe. You can even be a church person in your marriage. It still doesn&rsquo;t guarantee your partner won&rsquo;t go out.</p>



<p>The only thing that will stop your spouse from cheating on you is themselves not you.&nbsp; If they constantly remind themselves, they have someone who loves them back home. Making it their responsibility to control themselves from temptations.</p>



<p>You can only 100% guide you, with your partner you can&rsquo;t be 100%.&nbsp; But you need to trust them when temptations come. They will do the right thing.</p>



<p>There are things you can do to control yourself. Like telling yourself I can&rsquo;t be alone with another man. Because I&rsquo;m married. I can&rsquo;t have things like male friends. All that increase the risk and your chances of doing the wrong things.</p>



<p>We live in a digital age and we see more and more cheating starting from texting. Then keep growing until it something physical. Naked marriage is important than ever. If you are married there is no need for privacy. I must know everything about your passwords and accounts.</p>



<p>Cheating is a process. People start by talking, then dates before they will even sleep with each other.</p>



<p>Knowing everything about your partner still doesn&rsquo;t guarantee your spouse won&rsquo;t cheat. Though it decreases the chances of this happening.</p>



<p>I had a friend who was married and had two phones. One stayed in the car and he was only using it for cheating. Even with transparency we still can&rsquo;t be sure cheating won&rsquo;t happen in marriages.</p>



<h2>Parenting-styles differences</h2>



<p>Married couples turn to have different views when it comes to parenting. An example of this is when they discover their son is gay. It usually easy for a wife to accept the son as he is, but for a husband, it takes some time.</p>



<ul><li>Some parents let kids regulate themselves and be more like a friend to them. Instead of being a parent.</li><li>Some parents demand obedience from their kids. If kids don&rsquo;t obey, there will be a tough consequences.</li><li>Some parents have high expectation, yet loving at the same time. Not too hard on kids not too soft.</li><li>Some parents just don&rsquo;t care about their kids at all</li></ul>



<p>With this different style of parenting, it causes a problem in marriages. Especially in marriages where step kids are involved. Most wives like to raise kids in a friendly way. However, dads are usually hushing ones. This can sometimes lead to conflicts in marriages.</p>



<h2>Connecting with your busy spouse</h2>



<p>If you marry someone, you must agree. For better or worse you will stand by them.&nbsp; Even when you get busy and life gets busy. You will stand by them.</p>



<p>Connecting to your partner is so important in a healthy marriage. Me personally I really can&rsquo;t stand hours without talking to my wife. Even when I am busy, I make time. I want to know how she is doing and how her day is treating her.</p>



<p>Busyness leads to neglect. Once you neglect your partner, they get lonely. If loneliness enters your marriage. Then it&rsquo;s time to eliminate things that are not your priority. Like friends and everything that might not be your priority. Use that time to connect with your spouse. Marriage must be the number one priority of all time.</p>



<p>The wife can do so much at home to a point where the husband feels neglected. If you clean, cook, and put so much effort into helping kids. Sometimes that can make us as husband feel left out.</p>



<p>If you feel this way, then talk about it find a solution and balance.&nbsp; Because as small as this sounds, it can make a husband cheat on you. If he is feeling left out. Once he cheats the small problem is now a big one. You really need to connect with your busy spouse in your marriage.</p>



<p>It is not nice to miss your spouse while you stay with them. Couples slowly drift apart and later realize there are no longer in love. They are just a roommate.</p>



<h2>Feeling like a prisoner in your marriage</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/prisoner-in-your-marriage-1024x576.jpg" alt="prisoner in your marriage" class="wp-image-857"></figure>



<p>Marriages are not child&rsquo;s games. Many people get into marriage unprepared. If you enter marriage not knowing your partner enough, or if you enter marriage not knowing what is a marriage, or chose a wrong spouse. Then we can safely say you entered a marriage <strong>unprepared.</strong></p>



<p>Happens a lot and they realize later. This is not something they wanted. But it difficult to end a marriage, there is so much to lose.</p>



<p>Your wife moved out of her home and they are not expecting her to come back. You as a man you stand a chance of losing half of every you own. Their kids don&rsquo;t want you to break up. Because they will have to pick sides. You lose respect and time. That a lot and that why most people end up feeling trapped or feeling like prisoners in their own marriage.</p>



<p>If it was a relationship, my advice would be to end a relationship. But since it a marriage, I can&rsquo;t advise you to do that. Instead, I can advise you to take responsibility and say this is my marriage. I&rsquo;m going to fight for it. Start writing everything that making your marriage to move backward. Try to fix those issues.</p>



<p>Find people with similar problems. Whether it podcasts or online communities, or social media it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Find them and understand. How did they overcome the same problems that you are facing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time when I&rsquo;m angry at my wife and I listen to the podcast. I usually find out even though I&rsquo;m angry. I&rsquo;m also wrong and it is great to find advice from people who don&rsquo;t know you.</p>



<p>Because they don&rsquo;t hide the truth from you. They tell you everything as it is.</p>



<h2>Financial abuse in marriages</h2>



<p>Financial abuse in marriage is real and something most people are not aware of. Yet it plays a huge role in marriage problems and divorce. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Let look at housewives as our example. Some homemakers stay home by choice. They have talked about it with her husband, and the husband has no problem with providing for a family. If a wife wakes up one day. Start saying honey, I want to work now and be independent. The husband says no! because she wants her to always depend on him. That is financial abuse!</p>



<p>Financial abuse comes in many forms in marriages. There are situations where your spouse knows nothing about your finances. Where they are and how do use them. Inside marriage, this is abuse. Marriage will never be healthy. Until there is trust and transparency. If you hide your money from me. It makes me wonder, <strong>what else are you hiding from me?</strong></p>



<p>The other form of financial abuse we see all the time. When your spouse wants details of every cent you spend. If you went out and did shopping without them knowing. Even if it something useful which was really needed. They will still be mad at you.</p>



<p>Because you didn&rsquo;t talk to them first. This is financial abuse, and it&rsquo;s not like your partner was hiding it from you. If she tells you, &ldquo;while you were working, I thought we needed this, so I went out and bought it&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Financial abuse leads to domestic violence in most marriages. We live in a world where it cost money to do things. This is sad if you want to make your partner be 100% dependent on you.</p>



<p>When you don&rsquo;t even give them the freedom to do things they like. Just because you are the one providing.</p>



<p>Another practical example is when your partner is gambling vast amounts of money. You end up not knowing if there will be enough money left by the end of the month to pay bills. The days when your spouse lost in gambling, he will come home grumpy to everyone.</p>



<p>That financial abuse and it is sad to think some families go through all that.</p>

<h3>What is not a financial abuse in marriages</h3>



<p>If you set a budget together. Talk about how are you going to use both your finances. That not abuse but working together! When the money comes. You both know what are your priorities. How much you will be spending and how much you can use in your personal needs.</p>



<p>If your spouse wants to be involved in your financial decision that not abuse. If we are married it no longer your money but our money. So, it&rsquo;s nice if I get involved in decisions. Especially if the result is going to effects the family.</p>



<p>If your spouse asks you about the budget. That also not financial abuse you need a budget in your marriage.</p>



<p>But if you avoid all these questions about the budget. Yet your spouse wants to know. Then you are abusing your spouse.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Smartphone-Hurting-your-relationship-1024x576.jpg" alt="Smartphone Hurting your relationship" class="wp-image-849"></figure>



<p>There is a common pattern that has been growing around the world. Couples fighting for the reason that the other partner is obsessed with his/her phone.</p>



<p>This issue of smartphones is serious, and we have seen a lot of breakups. We still expect to see more. Today let talk about how you can avoid all that. I have been a victim of this, where I was in a relationship. Which ended because of the other girls I was chatting too.</p>



<p>This was wrong of me and it is something I&rsquo;m not proud off.</p>



<p>I also dated someone who was so obsessed with my phone. She will try to page my phone every minute she gets. When I was in the bathroom, sleeping, or whenever she can get her hand on my phone. Sometimes while I&rsquo;m using my phone. She would force me to show her, what I was doing or who am I talking too. I will have to explain every girl on my phone. Who is she and how am I related to her? It went on like that until I said you know what I can&rsquo;t take this anymore.</p>



<p>The last one was the worst! If she logs in on WhatsApp and finds me online. She needed to know who was I online with. If I check any messages in the middle on the night. We will talk about the last seen in the morning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Occasionally she will even require a screenshot. So, she can see who I was talking too. Which was unwise. I used to delete any conversation which can annoy her fast. Then send her the screenshot she wanted.</p>



<p>It was unhealthy, and I had many unhealthy situations in my past relationships. All around smartphones and a little of insecurities.</p>



<h2>The pain caused by smartphones</h2>



<p>It is toxic what these phones do in our relationship. If you use them the wrong way.</p>



<p>People are unhappy, there was this girl some other day. Who was complaining about her inboxes, she was getting each day.</p>



<p>Saying she get over 400 inboxes per day from different guys. She wants to reply, but it is too much. She doesn&rsquo;t even know where to start. So, she always avoids them all.</p>



<p>Now think about what her boyfriend feels about that. We are dating and I&rsquo;m loyal to you. Yet you get 400 inboxes from different guys. All of them with one intention, which is to date you.</p>



<p>How painful is that? I understand she doesn&rsquo;t reply. Which we have no proof she ignores all of them. The fact she gets them is painful on its own.</p>



<p>The sad part about this issue of smartphones. If a partner asks about the phone. The one who is obsessed with using a phone. Will ask &ldquo;why do we have to fight about my phone all the time because it is my phone?&rdquo; which is true. Though it is a wrong thing to say to your partner. It shows you don&rsquo;t care about their feelings.</p>



<p>Using smartphones constantly while with your partner. It makes your relationship feels disconnected. Your partner feels like a second choice. Important people in your life are the ones on your phone.</p>



<h3>Issues phone can cause in a relationship</h3>



<ul><li>Creates distance.</li><li>Creates conflicts. The person who feels ignored will try to talk to the high phone user.&nbsp; The addicted user will try to be defensive. So, they can get back to using their phones. This then led to conflicts.</li><li>Counted as cheating. If you are with other people online all the time. It feels like a betrayal.</li><li>Creates Secrecy. If your partner is constantly guiding their phone. It kills trust and a good relationship are built on trust.</li><li>Pornography is another problem with smartphones and relationships. If you are in a relationship and your watch porn all the time. You see all these different things people do and start to feel less satisfied. Because you want these things you see and your partner is not that person.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>When dating someone obsessed with their phone</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Phone-obsession-1024x576.jpg" alt="Phone obsession" class="wp-image-848"></figure>



<p>People are really obsessed with their phones. They take their phone with them when they are going to the toilet. When they eating dinner. Even when they are making love, and they hear the notifications. They think about check it or do it a few seconds after they finish making love. Someone won&rsquo;t even take the conversations seriously. Because while you talk to them, they are busy scrolling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can be on WhatsApp, Instagram, tick talk, or whatever. Some use social media for business. Some are influencers and it hard. Telling someone who makes a living on her phone to stop using it.</p>



<p>It can get so addictive to a point where they will completely forget about you. Or the plans they made with you as a partner. Which leaves you feeling neglected.</p>



<p>How do you know when it becoming an addiction, and it becomes a problem in your relationship?</p>



<p>If it getting in a way, you probably communicate or how you are being close with your partner. If your phone is feeling like a third person.</p>



<p>Then you must know it starting to be too much.</p>



<p>Talking about it and understand why they use the phone all the time. Sometimes it helps since to some it is business.</p>



<p>But if it not business, yet your partner is always on the phone.</p>



<p>it creates problems.</p>



<p>Even when your partner uses it for business. They must be limit. No one work 24/7, you need to have time to do other things. Time for your family and time to think.</p>



<p>The question we must ask, Is your phone more important than your relationship? If your answer is no. Then you really need to start and have a balance.</p>



<p>Even when you are not a social influencer. You still need to ask yourself that question. What is my priority here? Is it spending time with my partner? Or scrolling on and posting pictures on social media. Teach yourself to spend time with your partner and check your phone some other time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Fighting phone addiction</h2>



<p>Social media apps are created so we can use them all the time.</p>



<p>They collect data from everyone and use that data in us. So, we can be looked at by our phones every day. They can sell their product fast. It is your job to protect yourself from this addiction.</p>



<p>If you are on social media and you see sponsored posts. Someone is benefiting from that. If you are on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?gl=ZA">YouTube</a> and you see ads. Someone is making money through those ads.</p>



<p>So, it obvious they all want us to be addicted so, they can make more money. If I can give you one tip that will change your life forever.</p>



<p>It is simple, turn of all your notification<strong>. Just turn off</strong> all off them. Because they are the ones that trick you to check your phone all the time. If you use Facebook all the time.</p>



<p>Go to your settings &ndash; go to apps &ndash; go to Facebook &ndash; go to notification</p>



<ul><li>Disallow notifications</li><li>Disallow priority display</li><li>Disallow status bar</li><li>Disallow banners</li><li>Disallow display on lock screen</li></ul>



<p>You can do this process for all the other apps you are addicted to. If they bring no value in your life. It will change your life dramatically and instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your phone turns off maybe because of the battery and the minute you turn it on. You get a lot of notification you are locked in your phone right away.</p>



<p>If you turn off your notifications. You will still be on social media. The difference is that you won&rsquo;t get notified every time someone likes, comment, dm, inbox, tweet, etc.</p>



<p>You will only log in when you want to, not when you get a notification. Notifications can come every 3 seconds. But you won&rsquo;t even know someone sent something. Until you log in on your own time.</p>



<p>Not only notification tempt you to check your phone. Once you check that one notification, and you log in you get more notification. Then your start checking other things.</p>



<p>It hard to regain focus again even if you were busy with something else.</p>



<h2>Using your phone to help your relationship</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/use-it-the-right-way-1024x576.jpg" alt="use it the right way" class="wp-image-850"></figure>



<p>It clear by now phones are bad for most relationships. The good news is there are ways to use your phone to make your marriage or relationship better.</p>



<p>Phones can be bad if you use them badly. But can make a tremendous change if used the right way.</p>



<ul><li>You can use your phone to find out. What you can do to grow your relationship. Even by reading this post, the aim is to help you use less time on your phone. So you can focus on your partner, your life, or your job. That was the 1<sup>st</sup> step you using your smartphone to help you fight addiction.</li><li>Use your smartphone to connect with your partner. It is different to connect with your partner and connecting with the world. Me my wife use google hangout to connect. The reason for that is we tried things like WhatsApp. But it chaotic out there, you got your friends, family, and haters all in one place. So, we used <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">hangout</a>, and I only to her on hangout. We talk and video call one other. Because when she is not around, I want to know what she is doing. We want to be available to each other as much as possible. It important to show your partner she is the most important person in your life.</li><li>For your phone to help you make your relationship strong. You can not have any secrets from each other. You can&rsquo;t be afraid at any time if your partner picks your phone up. No need for passwords and patterns. Live open with no secret.</li></ul>



<h2>Respect your partner privacy</h2>



<p>If your relationship is still new maybe 1 or 2 years and your partner hasn&rsquo;t trusted you enough. For you guys to share everything like password and smartphone.</p>



<p>It nice to respect the privacy of your partner. That what I have been teaching myself over the year. If you check your partner&rsquo;s phone without them knowing. Even if you find something is still wrong. I understand if you are married you can not be having secrets. If it just a new relationship and they don&rsquo;t feel ready to show you everything.&nbsp; Then don&rsquo;t! because if your partner doesn&rsquo;t want you digging but you do. You will find what you are looking for.</p>



<p>You may not find what you looking for, maybe you will find worse.</p>



<p>Let me tell you my story about digging into the thing you must stay away from. I used to love YouTube, and every time I go there. People will talk about the dark web. I avoid it for so long because they were making it clear it the unpleasant side of the web. But it also tempted me. So, I downloaded the onion browser. Because it wasn&rsquo;t possible at the time to access it with any normal browser, which we use in our everyday life. The first site I went to was hidden wiki. It was the only one I knew, the first thing I saw was the library. I love books, so I check them out. Downloaded more than 100 books without even opening an account. Went back to hiddenwink tried other links and the things I saw there. Hunts me even today, it hard to get out my head. I have been trying for so long. Not only that, the book I downloaded there was all hacked, and they used them to still my information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could have avoided all that by just staying away from the dark web. The same thing with the smartphone, we tell people all the time to respect your partner&rsquo;s privacy. If your partner is not comfortable, don&rsquo;t. Stay away from your partner&rsquo;s phone. Unless they give you that right. Very few are listening and they get what they want. After that what happens it ends in tears.</p>



<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always mean your partner is cheating if they have a password and won&rsquo;t give it to you. Sometimes they are worried about their bank apps and confidential emails like bank statements.</p>



<p>But you think why would your partner hide her phone to you it means there is something going on. You are making your relationship unhealthy without proof.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you feel like your life is not moving. You have been at the same level for many years. It is time you step up your game. You can have everything you want just by believing you can.</p>



<p>Stop trying to belong, be selfish for once. Just focus on yourself.</p>



<p>Have planned moments with yourself and understand it is time for you to change. Even if it means cutting all your friends, social media, and everything that has been distracting you from starting your journey.</p>



<p>Friends can be a terrible inspiration. Think about what is it about your friend you love. What is it they bring to you or they are taking? It can be hard sometimes separating from the things we love. It needed some time so we can focus on us and accomplishing our goals. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HOPE-1024x576.jpg" alt="hope" class="wp-image-842"></figure>



<h2>The power of having hope</h2>



<p>I believe reading this today can take you to another level. Not only in life but also have respect in your relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can take the information that I give you today. Mine it and make it yours. Reading alone won&rsquo;t be enough. Start doing and start moving forward.</p>



<p>The wrong way of looking into success is to look at it as a destination. The finish line that one day you want to get to. No, don&rsquo;t look at it like that look at it as the life that you choose.</p>



<p>Look at it as something that yours already. If you want to be rich, start working hard like a rich man. Act as if you are there already.</p>



<p>Today I want you to believe that I can and I will be an overcomer. This will be true, you will get all you want and more.</p>



<p>We are all created to live in hope. That God has plans about me which will become a reality. So, I can become better for me and my family. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We were meant to live in hope, joy, and peace. Focus on hope today will be like rehearsing for your future freedom.</p>



<p>If we have hope, a lot of things happen. Your life may be in a tough time. If you have hope you don&rsquo;t get offended, you don&rsquo;t feel rejected or hurt.</p>



<p>All those offenses can&rsquo;t penetrate you. When there is an atmosphere of hope around you.&nbsp; When you meet people full of hope, you think life is kinder to them. But it only because they process things differently through courage.</p>



<p>Use your imagination the right way and it will lead you to the right things. Take the seed of faith. There is so much potential.</p>



<p>There will still be unknown. If you don&rsquo;t quite and grow worried. Everything around you perform better when there is hope. Your partner, kids everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Never forget the relationship works best when there is hope. </strong>Choose life</p>



<ul><li>Hope is a risky business and will get you disappointed most of the time. If you are going to live hopelessly, you will never get disappointed. But with courage even if you get disappointed, you are still going to simplify your purpose on earth. Whether your dreams come true. You trust yourself and your future. You will problem solve better when you have courage inside you. It might be a risky business, but great for problem-solving.</li><li>Hope is your choice. There are no hopeless circumstances, there are just hopeless people. What we need to do is control. Know what your thought are tonight. You get to choose what you focus your thought on. Whatever you focus your mind on. Will have a spike in your life the next day and the rest of your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Hope is not an illusion. It&rsquo;s not just wishful thinking but linked to the promises of God.</li><li>The power of words, can kill and give life. If you start a relationship. You only need your words, how powerful life can be. Even changing your life can only take a few words. You need to be very careful with the words you speak. What you want more, talk about it more. If you want more beauty in your life, take about it more. If you are in a situation of hopelessness. Talking about the positive and having hope can change your life. See your life with hope. Do not allow circumstances to dictate your life.</li><li>Hope is soil. It really saying I trust in him. Farms care for two things, seed, and the soil. If you take faith and hope, use it together and operate in love. You will be unstoppable. Do not wait for your certain circumstances to get better. Have hope now&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Stop making excuses to yourself</h2>



<p>Now after building hope. It is time for you to stop making excuses.&nbsp; Stop saying I want this, I want that. Now it is time for you to say I will get this <strong>no matter what.</strong></p>



<p>Not I wish, but I will. No matter how far away you are from it. Believing you will get it, will change your like. You may not get what you want. You will get other things in a process of getting it what you wanted.</p>



<p>Stop allowing yourself to get off the hook and have a commitment to the thing you want. Stop being a victim and blaming the past or your current condition. Hard work is all that you need in this world to get what you want. You don&rsquo;t even need talent.</p>



<p>Stop blaming things that are out of your control. Start using the things that are in your control. Ask your self what you need to do to be more like a champion. Instead of being a victim all the time. There are people who have originated in a worse situation than you and me. But today we praise them for what they have archived with nothing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Start doing, you will figure out things as you go. The way you do one thing is the way you do every. If you make excuses for yourself, you also make excuses in your relationship, you also make an excuse in your family, etc. when everything starts to go south in your life. You blade a lot of things. It is you who is making your life worse, by putting wrong energy in everything.</p>



<p>The way to get a lot of things done in your life is by you saying I will. Even if it gets hard. I&rsquo;m going to continue, anyway. If you stop giving excuses to yourself. You will see a change.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>How to stop avoiding the thing you want</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/stop-avoiding-1024x576.jpg" alt="stop avoiding" class="wp-image-843"></figure>



<p>Stop avoiding things you want to do. Stop being afraid to do things you want in your life. You keep coming up reasons not to do them, that is avoidance.&nbsp; Fight avoidance and fight that fire inside you. Do you have dreams? Yet you avoid the first step you must take. Which will lead you into your dreams?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You know people who can help. You avoid them, stop doing that today. You know everything you have been avoiding. Today you must sit down and ask yourself. Am I a bigger person than that or a failure who will never win?</p>



<p>Will you allow that small step to hold you back? Or are you going to get back in that momentum that you deserve?</p>



<p>Stop avoiding and ask yourself how can I attack this. Stop being lazy and defensive. Things you want, you must attack them all.</p>



<p>Ask yourself every day. What is it for me today? Not 3 days from now, not 4 months from now, and not when you hope it turns out.</p>



<p>Now! What must happen this day! Prioritize you have people who are going to depend on you. Be focus!</p>



<p>Always focus on what matters in your life. If your phone distracts you turn off. You can&rsquo;t afford any distractions.</p>



<p>Have a plan, if you don&rsquo;t plan you will burnout in life.</p>

<p>How to apologize to someone you offended and the power of apology. Saying I am sorry for hurting you can mean a lot to some people. But what I see is that it is very hard to apologize to a woman. Because even when you say forgive me, my love. They can hardly take that as a good apology and tell you to don&rsquo;t say it if you don&rsquo;t mean it. You think I have apologized, what more does she wants.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apologizing-1024x576.jpg" alt="apologizing" class="wp-image-815"></figure>



<p>Sometimes we don&rsquo;t even know how to apologize the proper way as men. Especially if dating, your partner will even tell you, to tell her, that you are sorry. But an apology is not something that you ask for, the person who did you wrong must always apologize. But not on your term because he must mean what he is saying. Not because you tell him to. </p>



<p>There are things you should never apologize for and there are things you should. It is your choice to beg for forgiveness. Women tell us when we upset them and we believe them. But do we apologize all the time, even when it was just a misunderstanding? <strong>Let talk about that.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">The do&rsquo;s and the don&rsquo;ts of apologizing</h2>



<p>The first thing we must understand when dating. You will never be loved 100% the way you want. I don&rsquo;t care if you have the richest man in the world or just a normal guy. Take out the thought people must be 100%. Because even you will be 100% in them.</p>



<p>What are the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of apology it a broad question. I am not an expert in apologizing and believe no one is an authority in apologizing. With apologizing will never be perfect. We all struggle in this, some do it more than they should. Some don&rsquo;t even know when to say it. Some don&rsquo;t even know how to react if you apologize to them.</p>



<p>The problem with most of us is when something happens. It is hard to accept that on me! Even though we are taught to say I&rsquo;m sorry. Most of us don&rsquo;t know how to say that well enough. So it means something to a person we are saying sorry to.</p>



<p>The apology is a gift and it tool that can be used to restore a relationship. More often to people we are close to. If you apologize to someone you say I care about you and I put the relationship first.</p>



<p>I care more about fixing your feeling than my pride.&nbsp; Apologizing is so difficult and it so humbling. Sometimes in saying I&rsquo;m sorry, you don&rsquo;t have the perfect words. You also fear saying wrong things which can make the situation worse.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s hard to control such situations and sometimes. I just wish I can hide and don&rsquo;t apologize. Just forget anything ever happened and that not possible too.</p>



<p>But in this situation what helps is to think about the relationship. How much it means to you. How much you love that person and how much are you willing to keep it.</p>



<p>If you really care about them and you believe them. When they say you upset me. You have no choice, but to apologize. Even if you know you are not wrong. It not about you being right. But you saving your relationship. Also, you caring for that person.</p>



<p>You must admit you are not perfect. Even though that hard to admit to other people.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Thing we can do to apologize well</h3>



<ul><li>The first thing you must do when apologizing is to use I. if you are saying you are sorry you need to take the blame. You can&rsquo;t say you are sorry. But still blaming the person you want to forgiveness from. Women sometimes apologize to expose your bad behavior. Which is not a proper way to apologize to someone. Your apology must be about you, not the other person. Before apologizing it helps to sit down with yourself first. Understand why you need to apologize and how will you do it.</li><li>Find the right time to do it. You need to make sure the other person is in a state to listen. The perfect time to say I&rsquo;m sorry is immediately when it happens. But I understand sometimes it can take some time for us to realize no, this was wrong. The minute you realize, say you are sorry. Because the sooner the better. Because sometimes you can feel that you are not ready to apologize. Claim your self down and when you feel you can do it. Do it!</li><li>See it on the side of the other person. Because most of the time what makes it hard to apologize. We focus too much on what we think and forget about the other person. You may have a unique perspective. However, just because you have a different perspective. Really doesn&rsquo;t mean you are right based on their perspective.</li><li><strong>Sorry without a change is not enough.</strong> If you say I&rsquo;m sorry to someone. Your action must change afterward.&nbsp; If you are sorry, it means you will change your behavior. Otherwise, there is no need for you to apologize, if you won&rsquo;t change. Above I said the aim to apologize is to repair and if you don&rsquo;t change. You are still harming the relationship. Change is so important. Because if you did something. That oven yourself agrees it is wrong. Yet you are doing it again. It really brings attention to you as a person.</li></ul>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Things we don&rsquo;t do when apologizing</h3>



<ul><li>The first thing that I see all the time. When someone is trying to apologize they use but. <strong>Don&rsquo;t say But! </strong>Because when you say I&rsquo;m sorry but! Your but is the only thing that person receives. If you apologize to me. I like that and for a moment I think you care about my feeling. However, the minute you say <strong>but</strong> I forget everything you said.</li><li>Saying you are sorry. While you are busy doing the other things.&nbsp; This really doesn&rsquo;t count. If you apologize, you must pay attention to your words and be in that moment of apologizing.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t expect someone to forgive you. Just after saying you are sorry. Even if you know you said I&rsquo;m sorry respectfully.&nbsp; But the pleasant thing is that you did. It will also give you relief if they don&rsquo;t forgive you. They have a right to do so and that on them. Understand forgiveness is a process, and it happens over time.&nbsp; Some people need to see you change before they can accept your apology. Some accept it right away. I am one of those. If you say sorry to me, I forgive you immediately. If I don&rsquo;t forgive you now, I might never. But the rest is on me. What more important is that you came to me and humbled yourself.</li><li>Avoid apologizing using text. Try the phone call or in person. What I noticed about the text is that some people can read it wrong. You can say something and mean it. But the other person can read it and get the wrong viewpoint. Beside it more respectful to say in person or in a call. Rather than just text.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t have expectations of the other person. There are times in life where. Someone will deeply hurt you, and you sit there waiting for an apology that will never come. Sometimes you might get it. But it won&rsquo;t be the one you hoped for. So, it really helps to don&rsquo;t have high hopes with things like someone saying sorry to you. You can teach yourself to forgive people without them saying I&rsquo;m sorry. Because some don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry in words. But they do something nice for you to say sorry. You on the other hand sit there waiting for an apology. But they think they have apologized. You can not change some people the only person you can change is yourself.</li><li>Never apologize if you feel, you don&rsquo;t want too, and you are sure. You were not wrong. Instead, tell your partner. You understand what you did was wrong and you will do better next time. </li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">The power on apologizing</h2>



<p><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Departments/Ombuds%20Office/files/M.Wagner.ColumbiaUniversity.OmbudsOffice.ThePowerofApologies.pdf">Harvard Medical</a> College made a study about the apology and the power behind forgiveness. People who are hurt or humiliated often wait for forgiveness. Why do we even need an apology?</p>



<ul><li>The first thing to be sure the same thing will never happens</li><li>To understand if something was done intentionally or not.</li><li>To repair our self</li><li>To earn respect</li><li>And to put that thing in the past</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nplinUox428?feature=oembed"></a></p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nplinUox428" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>This video explains how hard apologizing in men can be. But yet it is the most important thing for women. If you don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry. You build bridges with the person you are in a relationship with. You apology it the only thing that can fix things.</p>



<p>We sometimes think apologizing will make us look weak. But most of the time once you do it, it does the opposite effect. Most of the time in the relationship is wasted talking about the past. But this sometimes can be avoided. If we teach our self to say I&rsquo;m sorry when we are wrong. We can move on with our lives.</p>



<p><strong>Remember to say I&rsquo;m sorry and remember to say thank you. This will change your life.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Over apologizing</h2>



<p>We understand by now how important it is to say I&rsquo;m sorry. But do we really need to apologies all the time?  If we do what this says about us.</p>



<p>Once you teach yourself this, you can overdo it sometime. The problem with apologizing for everything. It creates this picture of you doing everything wrong. Just because you know you are going to say I&rsquo;m sorry. The more you say it, the more it feels unreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over apologizing can undermine you. It can also hurt your self-esteem, and no one is doing that to you. But you do that to yourself.</p>



<p>So, you need to find the balance. Don&rsquo;t overdo it, overdoing it doesn&rsquo;t always mean you say it over and over.</p>



<p>If you did something, and your partner is mad. All she need is your word that sincerely come from your heart. The roses can be nice. But once you start washing her car, calling her 300times, telling everyone to talk to her, showing up at her work, etc.</p>



<p>You are overdoing it and that not what she wants. That might frustrate her even more.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">When the apology is not accepted</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Apology-not-accepted-1024x576.jpg" alt="Apology not accepted" class="wp-image-817"></figure>



<p>When we say I&rsquo;m sorry, it doesn&rsquo;t always go as planned. Sometimes it can backfire hard and not always right away. It can backfire when you said you are sorry and then you went through and did the same thing all over again.</p>



<p>Sometimes your partner will be mad at you. But with no sufficient proof. Then you ask for forgiveness and it proves to her you did it. Which gets her even crazier.</p>



<p>They can use your sorry against you.</p>



<p>We don&rsquo;t like to request for forgiveness and find that they do not accept our forgiveness. But that does and will happen. There are things you can do if your admission of guilt is not accepted. Thich can help or stop the situation from getting worse.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>You must never take your apology back. Which you can take by your reactions. Because if you say I&rsquo;m sorry, you do it for the right reasons. If they reject you that on them.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be defensive or try to remind them how many times time they have been wrong, and you have forgiven them. It not about them this time, but you.</li><li>Give them space so they can process it.</li><li>Show your apology with your actions</li><li>Re-try visit some other time. Remind them you meant what you said and you are still sorry.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background">Exchange of apologies</h2>



<p>Sometimes your partner is wrong 50% and you also wrong in a way. But you must apologize to fix your partner and your partner need to apologize to you.</p>



<p>An outstanding example of this is when you did something wrong. Then your partner says hateful things to you just because you are wrong. After you apologize and your partner forgives you. The questions come flying in your head. If your partner really meant what she said to you.</p>



<p>Now even though the problem was about you. But they also need to apologize to you. So, you can heal too. Because what they said to you is very hurtful and you can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What usually helps me so I don&rsquo;t say hurtful things in the other person. I look into myself first and have respect for myself. Me respecting myself means I can say no, you can&rsquo;t say such things to others. Even if want to say it and it in my head. But I don&rsquo;t say it. Because I respect them more importantly, I respect me!</p>



<p>Exchanging apologies is great. Because in the end it not about you. If you made that person feel humiliated you own him too. Every time someone says I&rsquo;m sorry. It doesn&rsquo;t end there, you need to think about how you reacted to them.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t get defensive about it or make a justification. The reason you did wrong is that of what they did. NO, You had many ways to handle the situation, but you have chosen to be hurtful.</p>



<p>It is common for people who always expect people to apologize, to don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m sorry too. Or if they do say there are sorry, they include but you have. Or say I am only apologizing because&hellip;..</p>



<p>Thich is total wrong and don&rsquo;t qualify as a proper apology.</p>



<p>The other thing which you must know about exchanging apologies. which I might have talked about early. If you say I&rsquo;m sorry that doesn&rsquo;t mean it fixes everything right away. So, they might not apologize back right away. It can take a few hours sometimes even longer than that.</p>

<p>I and my wife were talking about the other last night. It seems like people like to make a big deal out of the small stuff.</p>



<p>She used to be like this, and there was a time where I was like this. But as you grow older, you realize this not how you live with others. We all make mistakes, there is no need to fight about everything.</p>



<p>Because having a tendency to make a big deal out of minor matters can ruin a relationship. I always tell people not to start a fight unless it beyond your powers.</p>



<p>If you make big deal out of everything. That when your partner might say you talk too much. This can be the beginning of an unhealthy relationship.</p>



<p>So, today I&rsquo;m saying, <strong>Stop Making A Big Deal Over the Little Things.</strong></p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-RhYewEbOz4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Find good habits for your relationship. This is the nasty habit and you must find a way to of breaking this habit. It does more harm than good.</p>



<p>There are many good patterns you can teach yourself. Same as bad ones, if you want a healthy relationship. You must stop the bad patterns.</p>



<p>If you make a big deal out of every minor situation. This means you controlling, and no one enjoys being with a controlling partner.</p>



<p>Once you stop making a big deal out of everything. This is when you will learn the skill to solve problems, without fighting with your partner.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to know your partner is old enough to know right for wrong.&nbsp; No need to remind him no, this is wrong every time.</p>



<p>He already knows what he did was wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Always ask yourself is this worth my time. It is easy to shout at people until we lose them.</p>



<p>I understand it can happen, that your partner thinks it not a big deal. But it is for you. That also happens all the time.</p>



<p>In a case, where your partner thinks it not a big deal and you think otherwise. Talk to them like the adult. They would understand no need to fight every time.</p>



<p>If you have talked to your partner several times and he keeps doing the same. Then we can make it a big deal.!</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Preventing fighting from ruining your relationship</h2>



<p>The first thing which is wrong. We think relationship and marriages are hard.</p>



<p>So, when our relationship has problems. We take this as normal and don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. So, we can deal with it.</p>



<p>We get advice. Relationships are hard work. If you want to stay in a relationship, fight to keep it.</p>



<p>But you don&rsquo;t fight for a relationship, which is health. If you must always fight for your relationship, that not health. Some day you might realize no, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>



<p>The problem started when you believed fight is normal in a relationship. A single fight can be normal. But if it happens often, that not normal.</p>



<p>You will have arguments, issues, and hard times. But should not escalate to fights. Because in a good relationship there is clear communication and problem-solving strategy.</p>



<p>Consistent fighting and making a big deal out of small things. That not normal and it could be your strategy of dealing with fight is not working. It can also mean one of you is falling out of love.</p>



<ul><li>Falling out of love can make you fight for things that don&rsquo;t matter.</li><li>It can also mean you are angry about something. That you haven&rsquo;t addressed yet. For example, they do not please you in bed. So everything upsets you.</li><li>You could fight about something that happened in the past. You have talked about it and it passed. But months later you re-think it and be angry. This time you show your anger in other things. Even though it is still connected to what happened in the past.</li></ul>



<p>This can make your relationship unhealthy, and you might not even realize it. If this continues it creates a bigger problem. Can even end the relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Break the circle of fighting</h3>



<p><strong>Deal with what in front of you right now.</strong></p>



<p>What I mean is, don&rsquo;t talk about what happened yesterday or the other month. Instead, fix only what you are talking about now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Leave-the-past-in-the-past-1024x576.jpg" alt="Leave the past in the past. Where it belong!" class="wp-image-795"></figure>



<p>If you had a problem and talked about it. Then your partner apologized. If he apologized and you saw, he meant what he said. Never bring that up again. Even when you are fighting about something else.</p>



<p>If it is something that happened last week. It must be completely off the table. You fix everything as it happens and moving on with your relationship. Without allowing problems to add up on top on one another.</p>



<p>Keeping a record of everything is wrong. First, you did this second, you did that, now you are doing this. That all wrong! </p>



<p>Because you have talked about it and came up with a solution. Why are you even mad about it for a week or a month later?</p>



<p>When you keep bringing up things. Which happened in the past, over and over. You are not allowing your relationship to move forward.</p>



<p>When you focus at the moment. Your communication skills will improve.</p>



<p>If you keep everything that happened in the past. You will win the fight. But your partner knows what you did in the past, too. So, if he is also bringing everything too, he will win. This means the conversation is not going forward and the relationship.</p>



<p>If you forgive someone it means you put that in the past. If it too much to forgive don&rsquo;t continue with that relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Words you need to avoid when arguing in the relationship.</h3>



<p>Let me assume the reason for you to read this article is that you are in a similar situation. Where you and your partner are always fighting and one is making a big deal out of everything.</p>



<p>I want to warn you about two words you should avoid when fighting. These words are 1 <strong>always </strong>2<strong> never!</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Always-and-never-1024x576.jpg" alt="always and never" class="wp-image-798"></figure>



<p>It is something you never thought about before. But it is very damaging.</p>



<p>It can take some time to break the habit. Knowing this is something I should stop will make you one step ahead.</p>



<p><strong>Let me make an example of what I mean.</strong></p>



<ul><li>You are always starting a fight</li><li>You always messing things up</li><li>We always do what you want us to do</li><li>You always make fun of me</li><li>I always must do everything</li><li>You always ignore me</li><li>You never listen to me</li><li>You never cared</li><li>You never help</li><li>You are never romantic</li><li>You never put effort into anything</li><li>You never let me choose</li></ul>



<p>Think about it. The chances of never and always being accurate are small to none. We use always and never when we frustrated or angry about something.</p>



<p>What these words do. They also make your partner frustrated too. Because even though your partner was wrong. Your partner won&rsquo;t agree with what you are saying. This can start a separate fight on top of the one. You are already fighting about.</p>



<p>Two, it puts extra blame on your partner. For example, if you say your partner always mess thing up. This means since the day you meant them. They always mess thing up and that such a wrong thing to say.It not fair to say because it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>



<p>Get to the root of the problem. Solve that problem without involving everything that happened before<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t get to the root of the problem. You leave that problem unsolved. Because instead of solving it. You brought back the old one. Even those were not solved. Because you also brought the older ones.</p>



<p>This becomes a chain of unsolved problems, and they will keep coming up. Causing you to fight all the time!</p>



<p>This can make you make a big deal out of small things. Because a lot of problems are stuck in your head unsolved.<br>Let us say your partner is talking about something you do that they don&rsquo;t like. But they are not fighting with you yet. Telling you what they don&rsquo;t like.</p>



<p>If you respond by saying, you always picking a fight. This means you don&rsquo;t care about their feelings and you are reversing the problem to them.</p>



<p>The next thing that is going to happen. The fight will worsen. The other partner may even become more frustrated. Because you show you don&rsquo;t even care.</p>



<p>So, this way of handling things solves no problem. It makes things worse!</p>



<h4 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">If your partner use always or never in you. What then?</h4>



<p>There will be a time where your partner says you always do this, or you never do this. You as a person who already knows. How damaging those words can be. You must have a different manner.</p>



<p>If your partner says. You always pick a fight. You must keep calm and say come sit down here, let talk about it. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. That I always pick a fight. I know we need to be better in handling our problems. Show your partner you care about their feelings. </p>



<p>Ask them what is it moving forward that they want you to do. To solve this problem.</p>



<p>You are solving a problem. Instead of reversing the problem to the other partner or bringing up the past.</p>



<p>Understand what exactly is bordering your partner right now. What role can I play moving forward to make things better for us? How can we make this better together?</p>



<p>If you talk to your partner like this. They feel</p>



<ul><li>You are hearing</li><li>You respect their feelings</li><li>You care</li><li>You are working together as a team.</li></ul>



<p>By doing this, it can cool the other partner way faster. Showing you care, makes the other person feel loved and acknowledged. This is why you are together.</p>



<p>Your partner doesn&rsquo;t want to be angry. They are not speaking to you to annoy you. They are trying to solve the problem. So don&rsquo;t make the problem worse.</p>



<p>If you tell your partner &ldquo;you never listen to me&rdquo;. This means they have never listened to you, ever since you started dating. How true is that?</p>



<p>It like you are telling your partner, they are always wrong and the only reason you are still together is you. Which is not fair!</p>



<p>Each person has a unique mind and voice. Using always and never will make your relationship to grow apart. This will cause a lot of unnecessary fights. Without you understanding where they have come from.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Tips for fighting fair</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIGHTING-FAIR-1024x576.jpg" alt="FIGHTING FAIR" class="wp-image-807"></figure>



<p>This article is about a relationship. Where partners fight all the time. The relationship where everything turns in to a big deal. The aim is to help you reduce fight in your relationship. &nbsp;Because fight can turn even a perfect relationship into a sour one.</p>



<p>So, we need to look at this problem in many viewpoints and give you unique solutions.</p>



<p>There are many ways partners deal with the conflict. Both partners must not try to win the conversation. Without interest in solving the problem.</p>



<p>Both partners want the fight to end. But it cannot if the fight is going in the wrong direction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is a problem in your relationship. But both of you are defensive. It is less likely you will move forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do you fight fair?</strong></p>



<ol type="1"><li>There is a saying don&rsquo;t go to bed angry. It&rsquo;s time we rethink that. We must teach our self to take a break if something is frustrating us. Even if that means going to bed angry, it is fine we will talk about it tomorrow. But this will help us avoid saying things we don&rsquo;t mean because we are angry. It also gives us time to think. The next day you might even realize. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this anymore, it is not worth the time. This will help us stop saying things in a mean way, harsh and hurtful. Saying things that can&rsquo;t be forgetting.</li><li>The second method of fighting fair is the one we talk about early to stop using the words always and never. Because they are not accurate, and they do more harm than good.</li><li>Find a solution. Stop fighting back your partner. Work together so you can find a solution.</li><li>Focus on the present. Forget about the past wrongs.</li><li>Never interrupt your partner. Let your partner finish and give your viewpoint.</li><li>Apologize if needed.</li><li>Never fight in front of your kids. Children a copycat, if you fight opposite to them. They might fight the other kids at school. You might blame them. But it is you who are teaching them the wrong things.</li><li>Watch your words.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Conclusion</h2>



<p>If your relationship is always boiling and you fight all the time. Learn to listen to your partner. Forget who is wrong for a moment and focus on how we can solve this.</p>



<p>Be loving to each other. Find the strategy to solve problems in your relationship. But you can&rsquo;t come up with a strategy during fights.</p>



<p>Coming with a strategy will need both partners to be cool and claim. Talk about your bad habits that are costing a relationship. When you are both in the right space.</p>



<p>Communication is the key, talk to your partner, and a find solution. </p>

<p>Make sure, you ready are you. Find out is he dating someone currently. Check if has he made enough effort and do you love him or what you love what he did. If you were to date him will you complete him and what is his HIV status?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Birthday-1024x576.jpg" alt="Things every woman should do, before she says yes to a relationship" class="wp-image-680"></figure>



<p>Starting a relationship is a huge decision. But sometimes we just jump into a relationship without asking our self what am I getting myself into. Sometimes a relationship can work just fine. Though sometimes that can be a death sentence.</p>



<p>Just because a man came to you and told you what he wants. Doesn&rsquo;t mean he meant every word. The average men stop at least 3 girls per day and say the same words to all of them.</p>



<p>Now how can you easily trust a guy? I have found myself in a position where I talk to a girl, thinking I like her.</p>



<p>Then 3 weeks later, I don&rsquo;t want to be part of that relationship. Why? Sometimes we as guy enter a relationship just because someone looks good.</p>



<p>After we sleep with her that when we realize we never wanted a relationship.</p>



<p>As a female, you need to be careful before you start a relationship.</p>



<p><strong>Check yourself, check the person you are about to date!</strong></p>



<p>As you grow, you should worrier about wasting time. If you enter a relationship and a year later you realize it not for you.</p>



<p>You just wasted a year, and you are not getting any younger.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Is this man dealing with trust issues, emotional scares, or immaturity?</p>



<p>If you answer yes to any of these questions, that man may not be your best choice.</p>



<h2>How ready are you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-ready-are-you.jpg" alt="How ready are you" class="wp-image-687"></figure>



<p>If the prior relationship ended, it means somehow that relationship broke you.</p>



<p>Yes, the last relationship ended, but have you moved on?</p>



<p>If you are not ready, just tell a guy I&rsquo;m not ready. Stop entering a relationship with problems.</p>



<h2>Does he have a girlfriend?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Does-he-have-a-girlfriend.jpg" alt="Does he have a girlfriend? " class="wp-image-683"></figure>



<p>There is this strange thing most girls do. They ask after sex if you have a girlfriend or not. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If I say yes what different does is it make, we slept already?</p>



<p>&nbsp;You already have feelings for me? If a guy says I love you, you must find out if they have a boyfriend as easily as possibly.</p>



<p>Unless you are tolerable with being a side chick.</p>



<h2>Has the effort been established?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Has-the-effort-been-established.jpg" alt="Has the effort been established? " class="wp-image-685"></figure>



<p>Don&rsquo;t make it easy, even if you feel you love him. Make sure he will fight for this relationship.</p>



<p>If a guy doesn&rsquo;t fight to win a relationship, he will never fight to keep it.</p>



<p>A boyfriend or someone who is interested but doesn&rsquo;t make the effort to speak to you, or see you and show you he needs this to work.</p>



<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care. At the early stage of the relationship, a guy must cancel plans just to be with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A man who wants you should never be reminded to treat you the way you deserve to be treated.</p>



<p>If a guy makes excuses before you even say yes! Don&rsquo;t waste time, move on!</p>



<h2>Has he expressed how he feels about you</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Has-he-express-how-he-feels-about-you-.jpg" alt="Has he express how he feels about you " class="wp-image-684"></figure>



<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t wonder is he into you or not. He must express that to you. <strong>Don&rsquo;t assume</strong>!</p>



<p>Some women are ignorant, they believe some guy doesn&rsquo;t show emotions. Because of that how guys are wired. That the wrong stereotype.</p>



<p>Men express their romantic feelings, but not to every girl. If he expresses himself deeply you are special.</p>



<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t express himself, just know he knows how to. If you don&rsquo;t believe me wait until you do something wrong. He will express in every direction how what you did was wrong. If you think guys don&rsquo;t know how to express themself, think again!</p>



<h3>Stop relying on direct sighs like</h3>



<ul><li>The way he holds you.</li><li>The way he is always available when you need him.</li><li>The way he gives you money</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>While that can be a good sign it can miss lead you. Remember, we are talking about a guy you haven&rsquo;t said yes to.</p>



<p>He might do those things to sleep with you. You don&rsquo;t know if he has good intentions for you. Maybe after you sleep with him, he might start playing games with you.</p>



<p>Communicate like a human being. You are not an ape. Do you miss me and how do you feel about me? Those questions are wrong and the answer won&rsquo;t be honest.</p>



<p>To understand a guy, you must listen to him talking about you for several days. Paying attention to every word. Because some guys will even forget what they said the previous day and say something totally opposite. &nbsp;If he does that you know he doesn&rsquo;t mean what he is saying.</p>



<p>We as men are very romantic and we not afraid to tell you if we miss you. But if you must ask us if we miss you, then something is wrong. We can tell you what we see in you and if we can&rsquo;t express that.</p>



<p>Maybe we are not into you, we are just fooling around.</p>



<h2>Do you love him or something he did?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Do-you-love-him-or-it-something-he-did.jpg" alt="Do you love him or it something he did?" class="wp-image-682"></figure>



<p>Girls make many mistakes when they enter a relationship, and one of them is to say yes just because a guy did something.</p>



<p>Maybe just because he bought lunch. This why most relationship and marriages fail.</p>



<p>Once you take a girl out, she says yes. Once a guy does something she falls into a trap. Keep in mind we as guys know what you girls like and we do those things to win you easy.</p>



<p>But even so, as a girl you need to do your homework. Be sure if this is what you want. Know him, know his just past and more.</p>



<p>It is always good to write what you want in a man before you say yes.&nbsp; Understand if this man was to lose his job can you continue dating him. Can you learn something from him?</p>



<p>Jumping to things just because he did something once or twice. What if you jump in and a week later you realize he is abusive?</p>



<p>What if he can do nice things, but he is controlling as hell?</p>



<p>Do your homework, take your time look into him. Visit his social media to learn what type of person he is. Does he flirt with every girl?</p>



<p><strong>You must know all that to make a wise decision.</strong></p>



<p>My aim is to help you stop wasting time with the relationship that will fail in no time.</p>



<p>Without the magic of chemistry, a relationship can&rsquo;t sustain itself. If you say yes for the wrong reasons, you will be bored in that relationship and you will regret your decision.</p>



<p>Men who give you everything turn to do as they please. Most girls can allow them, but soon or late they realize they deserve better.</p>



<p>You can avoid all that drama and enter the relationship for the right reasons.</p>



<h3>What are the right reasons to enter a relationship?</h3>



<ul><li>To share, love</li><li>To learn and grow together</li><li>To have children with the right person</li><li>Friendship and fun</li><li>Mutual support</li></ul>



<h2>Do you complete him?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Do-you-complete-him.jpg" alt="Do you complete him?" class="wp-image-681"></figure>



<p>&nbsp;According to the bible woman were created to make a life on a man better.</p>



<p>If you see something wrong with your man and you don&rsquo;t care.<strong> You don&rsquo;t love him!</strong></p>



<p>Which is why it is a sin to sleep with a girl before marriage. A woman is with you to improve your life. So, as a man, you must respect that and make her your wife.</p>



<p>You must be thinking what this has to do with me saying yes to a relationship? A lot actually!</p>



<p>A guy will tell you why the last relationship didn&rsquo;t work. Will you make the same mistakes? Forget who was wrong in the prior. Understand what he is looking for this time.</p>



<p>If the prior relationship failed because her girlfriend cheated. You know you also have a problem with cheating. Then it is obvious you don&rsquo;t complete him, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you like him.</p>



<p><strong>You are not in his life to make his life better, but worse!</strong></p>



<p>A man that had a problem with money spending and met someone who can help him. &ldquo;no baby this not how you use money, try this instead.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Even if they break up, he will always have a soft spot for her. Because she came with the change in his life.</p>



<p>You must always think is there anything I can do to complete this man.&nbsp; So that if any girl can come throwing her to him. He will see that girl as the trouble that is here to end his relationship, and he doesn&rsquo;t want that.</p>



<p>You can date a complete person, but somehow, they realize you bring no value to them and move on.</p>



<p>Man can stay for years with someone they don&rsquo;t love. If that girl completes him and pleasant thing along the way he realizes he can not live without her.&nbsp; Then you might hear him saying I never thought we would make it this far.</p>



<p>This means he was just fooling around and found value and stayed forever. Which is nice!</p>



<p>Therefore, man sometimes ends up marriage someone who was a housemaid. That maid brought more value than his girlfriend. Not that I encourage this, but it happens.</p>



<p>By me saying complete him. I don&rsquo;t mean cooking, washing, and buying things. Yes, all that can be nice. But even simple things like telling him to visit his mother. This alone can make him see you differently, especially if the previous girlfriends never told him to.</p>



<p>Some girls will sleep with a guy and make a request or ask for money, then go home.</p>



<p>They won&rsquo;t even ask &ldquo;baby you are working why don&rsquo;t you do 1 and 2? Because by doing this it can help you with this and this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>They make the relationship all about them. You don&rsquo;t call me anymore, you don&rsquo;t take me out, you don&rsquo;t give me money and more.</p>



<p><strong>But if you don&rsquo;t bring value, why expect one</strong>?</p>



<p>Listen to his story, take some time. Before you say yes, can you complete him? The relationship isn&rsquo;t a one-way street where a man must meet all your qualifications and you lay claim.</p>



<p>You both must work on something.</p>



<p>Any relationship can last six months to a year, but if it still growing after year, respect that relationship.</p>



<p>Be the right woman for the man you are falling for, not just because he meets your requirements.</p>



<p>Know why you are falling, don&rsquo;t think you will find answers after you start dating.</p>



<h2>HIV status</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/HIV-status.jpg" alt="HIV status" class="wp-image-686"></figure>



<p>This is the second thing girls do wrong. They don&rsquo;t ask you about HIV status until it too late.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Most girl fears to ask a guy about his HIV status. &nbsp;But the truth is, asking alone won&rsquo;t help. He might not give an honest answer.</p>



<p>The best practice if you feel that you love him is to ask him to go with you. So, you can both get tested.</p>



<p>According to the book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Story-AIDS-Experts-Questions/dp/1557989842">The Inside Story on AIDS: Experts Answer Your Questions</a>&rdquo;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/41R0K75XZHL._SX305_BO1204203200_.jpg" alt="the book &ldquo;The Inside Story on AIDS: Experts Answer Your Questions&rdquo;" class="wp-image-698"></figure></div>



<p>A person can be exposed to HIV and test negative. The book also makes it clear that you can have HIV and test negative.</p>



<p>How is this possible?&nbsp; If you have HIV, but your body hasn&rsquo;t started fighting it. Your body won&rsquo;t produce antibodies against HIV. Your immune system must discover the virus and produce the antibodies that will fight HIV.</p>



<p>Expect in this book say a person can test negative for 3 months to a year depending on your blood while he/she has HIV.</p>



<p>Now that we know that, what this has to do with you?&nbsp; Before you enter the relationship, asking if a guy has HIV won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>



<p>Because he might think he is negative and has papers to prove it. But we know you can test negative even when positive.</p>



<p>This applies not only to him, but to you too. You might think you are negative based on your last result, but maybe you are not.</p>



<p>Going for an HIV test together will help you both if you end up saying yes to relationship.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t do that and later you are both sick. Don&rsquo;t blame him, and he can&rsquo;t blame you. Just face the reality and talk about what you going to do now that you have it.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>After doing all that it time for you to tell him I&rsquo;m ready for this relationship. Whatever you have been doing on your side, stop. Because I&rsquo;m your girlfriend now.</p>



<p>Talk about your likes and dislikes. I wish you a happy dating.</p>
