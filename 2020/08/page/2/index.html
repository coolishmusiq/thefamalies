<p><a href="https://www.yourdictionary.com/family">Family&nbsp;</a>is one of the most important and has always been the most important thing in our lives. The bond that links your genuine family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other&rsquo;s life. </p>



<p>If there is respect, no one can break that family. A family is a risky venture, because the greater the love, the greater the loss. A happy family is an early heaven, it is what most people pray for.</p>



<p>A family is a place where principles are hammered and honed on the anvil of everyday living. But it a test of freedom. Because the family is the only thing that a man makes for himself and by himself. </p>



<p>For children, trying to understand the changing dynamics of the family may leave them distracted and confused.&nbsp; A child needs to realize that <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">if her family is full of caring people, her family is special.</span></strong></p>



<p>Effect on the family may differ according to family structure. The family may again experience feelings of anger and depression.</p>



<p>Your family can also share a photo album, a family calendar, and even help locate each other&rsquo;s missing devices. We can play family music that the entire family can enjoy together. </p>



<p>The support of friends and family can play a very important role in someone recovering from depression.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Benefits-of-having-a-family.jpg" alt="Benefits of having a family" class="wp-image-613"></figure>



<p>The Family that believes in God has Everything. However, I am not saying you must take your family to church. <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Believing that there is God</span></strong> can be enough for most families. </p>



<p>The family does not only mean people you share the same blood with, but it can also be friends or work partner. &nbsp;It can be anyone you share your tragic secret with, without them using that against you.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Funny things together as a family.</h2>



<ul><li>You can cook and bake together as a family. While allowing kids to help where they can.</li><li>Plan a picnic at the beach or pack, put food in the basket and just enjoy life.</li><li>Indoor Treasure Hunt for Children can be a cool idea. Give them clues to find location or items, even candies.</li><li>Go on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and learn simple magic tricks and play with children.</li><li>Play puzzles is another classic way to have a good time with your family.</li><li>Watch family movies.</li><li>Plan a Christmas party around the summer.</li><li>Plant seedlings and watch everything grow kids love that.</li><li>BBQ day, we all enjoy having a barbecue and cooking outside.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Create a healthy family lifestyle</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Create-a-healthy-family-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Create a healthy family lifestyle" class="wp-image-614"></figure>



<p>Teach your family to eat healthy and organic food. The entire meal doesn&rsquo;t have to be organic, but must always have at least one organic piece.</p>



<p>With long working hours and school for kids, eating organic can be a good thing in the evening. Get kids involved in the garden at an early age. Kids must be proud to bring vegetables in the kitchen and some fruits.</p>



<p>Organic food can help a family live a long and healthy life. If you love and live with your family, it is less likely that you will die from drugs or any terrible addictions.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">The benefit of spending time with your family</h2>



<ul><li>You develop parenting skills, the more time you spend with kids the better you will understand them.</li><li>Improves your kids learning skills both at home and at school. If kids are happy home, they are more likely to perform better at school and at home.</li><li>Spending time with your family also creates a good family bond. The family feels close to each other and this always a delicate thing. Understanding your family fully requires a lot of time. It is not something you can do in a week.</li><li>More chance of success if families support each other, even in threatening times they have your back. The more time you spend with your family will increase your chance of success.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Family values</h2>



<p>Now let look at something which is important,&nbsp;family values. No one is born knowing what their family values are, but it is what we learn as time goes.</p>



<p>They are important to the structure and well-being of the family. They always reflective of their times and environments, yet most cultures share several common threads for basic values and morals. </p>



<p>When parents show that family values are important, a child gets the structure and boundaries needed to find his or her own place within those values and morals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image is-style-rounded"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/download-3.jpg" alt="Mother Teresa" class="wp-image-616"></figure></div>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What can you do to promote world peace? Go home and love your family.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots">



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Mother Teresa</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>You can discuss with your family what they value the most. Formal meetings to discuss family values are not always necessary. But they help in most times. </p>



<p>This can be the backbone to a healthy family, can be the foundation that guides us. This can reflect who we are and how we parent.</p>



<p>Family values are the foundation for how children grow and are taught. We usually pass traditional family values from one generation to the next, giving children the structure and boundaries in which to function and thrive. </p>



<p>If you come from an excellent family you are more likely to have a wonderful family of your own. When it&rsquo;s time to do so. Strong and consistent family values are important in building trust and confidence in each family member. </p>



<p>Therefore, it can have a positive impact on your children&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>



<p>Throughout my experiences, I have noted time and time again how cultural and household values can affect career decision-making. Instilling good family values can assist your children to reach their full potential at school.</p>



<p>Eventually, your family values will be specific to you and your family. A solid set of it will allow each of us in our family to make it through the tough times. </p>



<p>A lucky family with strong values will produce children with high self-esteem, children who enrich the world around them, children who are catalysts of change.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background">Family reunion</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dercetus-%C2%B7-SlidesCarnival.jpg" alt="Family reunion" class="wp-image-615"></figure>



<p>Family Reunion is real, memorable, toe-tapping, heart-stopping, laugh out loud authentic moments. Seeing the entire clan at a family can be a lot of fun. </p>



<p>We can hold a Family Reunion between a mother and child, a brother and sister, a group of siblings, a group of family members including Elders such as grandparents, aunties, and uncles, cousins, nephews, and nieces.</p>



<p>They are outstanding expenses related to a small family reunion that is minimal and can be planned easily. But this will differ if you plan a family reunion by yourself, or it is the entire family idea. </p>



<p>They can be expensive, so they need excellent planning. If you will do it yourself, make sure you are financially ready before you tell the entire family. </p>



<p>It nice to do them often but this can be difficult if members are only close during the holidays, but it can become an annual event that all family members look forward to! </p>



<p>Setting a date for a large-scale event like a family reunion can be difficult. Because you need to pick a date where most family members can be available like Christmas time. </p>



<p>Planning your family reunion will be easier if you understand the family&rsquo;s objectives and reasons for gathering. What is important is to understand that not only adults will attend the reunion, but kids too. </p>



<p>Pleasant thing is that now you can hire some agencies for planning everything, to ensure that your family reunion will be memorable for all.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish you a great and successful life. Learn to <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/how-do-you-express-love-to-your-family/">put your family first</a> at all times. Love your kids with all you have and believe in them. You will face challenges, but you must never stop believing in your family. Always be available if needed. Surprise them and always learn a new thing to do with your family.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about couples parenting together hand-in-hand parenting. Nothing brings joy and trouble at the same time as having a new baby. But if you and your partner work together hand in hand, it will work out just fine.</p>



<p>60% of the couple&rsquo;s happiness drops upon parenthood. There are many reasons for this, how the baby should be carried for and by who. </p>



<p>The wives usually complain men don&rsquo;t do enough for babies. You will hear a man saying &ldquo;honey he&rsquo;s crying again&rdquo;. </p>



<p>Husbands feel cheated as their time alone with the wife is no longer available, crowded out by a baby with endless desperate needs.</p>



<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. There are things you can do together which will improve your parenting.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hand-in-hand-parenting-tips-1024x576.jpg" alt="Hand in hand parenting tips" class="wp-image-538"></figure></div>



<h2>Kids cry all the time</h2>



<p>Understanding crying is healthy, normal, and good for children. Crying is their way to communicate with us. Some parents whip their children for just crying.</p>



<p>However, sometimes you must let your child after they finish crying they think clearly. </p>



<p>I don&rsquo;t completely ignore my daughter when she cries. But I don&rsquo;t always intervene unless it necessary for me to do so. </p>



<h2>Set limits</h2>



<p>Setting limits for your child is not always easy. Most parent feel bad if they say no to their child and it is understandable because we love them.</p>



<p>But setting limits will teach our kids self disciples skills. limits also keep our children safer.</p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t set limits for your kids at the early stage. The result for that will reflect in your child&rsquo;s behavior when they grow up.</p>



<h2>Reward your kids if they did well</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/reward-your-kids-1024x576.jpg" alt="reward your kids" class="wp-image-542"></figure></div>



<p>Rewarding your kids if they did well helps you motivate and inspire your kids. Your children can easily understand what they are doing good and improve on that. </p>



<p>The rewards can be big or small but the idea is to tell a child you did well don&rsquo;t stop doing this. </p>



<p>Even candy can be a reward, but this depends on your child&rsquo;s age. They&rsquo;re pleasant things that our children do that need to be rewarded. </p>



<p>like when our kids are <a href="http://link%20to%20Helping%20Your%20Children%20Learn%20To%20Share%20Helping%20Your%20Children%20Learn%20To%20Share">learning to share,</a> we must encourage such  behaviors.</p>



<h2>Play with your kids</h2>



<p>I always encourage parents to be friends with their kids. Your kids need to respect you, but they must not be afraid of you. </p>



<p>If your child is experiencing difficult parent must be the 1st to know. </p>



<p>This why important to play with your kids so they are more relaxed around you. </p>



<p>Finding time to play with your kids is a good thing, but you must know when to stop.</p>



<p>There is a lot you can do with your kids play out door, play games, read books together.</p>



<h2>Mother and father parenting together</h2>



<p>Children have many benefits when a mother and a father work together as partners. Studies show that children become better when parents are together. A single parent faces major difficulties. </p>



<p>A single income and no one around for daily support.<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><strong> Being a single parent is not impossible, but it&rsquo;s difficult.</strong></span></p>



<p>Some parents may have a hard time with the father of the baby. But if they still stay together because a mother puts the child first. That can be a good thing in the long run.</p>



<p>Children need to have a special relationship with their father. A dutiful father will teach children the main important things. If a mother is encouraging the father to have a relationship with his children, she is not only helping the father but the kids too.</p>



<p>Parents can share the responsibility of raising their children. They must share everything, including expenses. So that no one can feel used. It&rsquo;s also important for parents to be honest about their feelings. They must understand relationship Romance might be over maybe it will continue after 10 years.</p>



<h2>The role of a father </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="border-color:#fcb900"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-vivid-red-color"><p>&ldquo;Anyone can father a child, but being a dad takes a lifetime.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Father&rsquo;s role in a child is always important. Fathers must provide security to a child. Not only that, but a father must also teach most activities at home.</p>



<p>As a father, you must be supportive and sensitive to your child. If you give your kids love and support, they make you proud.</p>



<h2>Supporting your kids</h2>



<p>Most studies show kids with supportive parent do well in school and in everything else.</p>



<p>You must actively encourage kids to do their best in school, hobbies, and interests.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t be hard on your kids, allow them to make mistakes. Have respect for their feelings and concerns.</p>



<h2>Providing a safe home</h2>



<p>To provide a safe home, both parents need to work together to provide their children with a safe home. Both parents must work together and teach their kids about the surrounding danger. </p>



<p>Lots of things can be dangerous to our kids like Jiki, electrical outlets, candles, and chemicals that are found in a home, etc. this thing can be dangerous to children. Parents need to work together to teach and provide a safe home.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Providing-a-safe-home-1024x576.jpg" alt="Providing a safe home" class="wp-image-549"></figure></div>



<p>Some parents are abusive, kids may need to stay away. If you plan to provide a safe home, you must work hand-in-hand and ensure no one abuses children. If children see both parents happy together, they feel secured.</p>



<h3>Things you can do while growing children&rsquo;s</h3>



<ul><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">going on dates</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">closing the bedroom door and teaching your kids to knock</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">teaching your kids not to interrupt your conversation</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">making sure your kids realize you have made up after an argument</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">kissing and hugging each other affectionately, not passionately in front of your kids</span></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">if you plan to parents together, you must also not forget to love one another if you treat each other with respect your kids will grow up treat others with respect</span></li></ul>



<h2>Rules for parenting together</h2>



<h3>Rule number one</h3>



<p>Never undermine your partner. It is easy to do this on a daily basis, but if you undermine your partner in front of your kids. It makes him feel powerless.</p>



<h3>Rule number two</h3>



<p>If you teach discipline, you must be disciplined. To teach your kids about making their beds, every time they wake up. Your bed needs to be on point every day. </p>



<h3>Rule number three</h3>



<p>If you or your children are being abused, ask for backup. The mistake most parents do when they are being abused. They keep quiet. You must ask for help. Otherwise, it will affect how your kids grow.</p>



<h3>Rule number four</h3>



<p>Avoid fighting in front of your kids. Nothing wrong with having arguments with your partner. But learn to take your fight into the bedroom. Fighting can frighten and worried children.</p>



<h3>Rule Number 5</h3>



<p>Never badmouth your partner, while trying to have a hand in hand parenting. you must teach your kids how to speak, and how not to. So if you talk badly about your partner. They will also learn that too.</p>



<h3>Rule number six</h3>



<p>Respect your partner parenting Style. mum can be mum and dad can be a dad. Kids will adapt and understand both. Therefore, they need you both.</p>



<h2>Family meals</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;family&nbsp;must always make time for a&nbsp;family&nbsp;meal. Even when parents work various schedules, they must try to make it at least once a week. It is important to have a traditional evening. sitting as a&nbsp;family&nbsp;asking kids about their day, how was the school, if they have homework or not. </p>



<p>This is not only about the meal. But to enjoy each other company. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what time you choose to make a&nbsp;family&nbsp;meal. As long as you make time for them some days you must take it out it&rsquo;s still a&nbsp;family&nbsp;meal but in a different environment teach your kids&rsquo; table manners.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Kids are a gift from God, and they need both parents. Love your kids, protect your kids, be there. Never be abusive! Reward them play with them. Be a perfect mom, be a perfect dad. Hand in hand parenting makes life for both parents much easy. </p>



<p>I wish you the best.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/download.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-185" width="275" height="183"></figure></div>

<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p class="has-text-color has-background has-vivid-red-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">By the end of this post, you must be able to understand what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t. Dating has been there for over 500 generations. However, there are rules which used to work back then. Which still works today and will continue to work for the Next Generation. </p>
</div>

<h2>What does a healthy relationship look like&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you want to have a healthy relationship. The perfect place to start is to understand what is a healthy relationship. Sometimes it is difficult, especially if you don&rsquo;t have a relationship to look up to. You end up not understanding what your partner expected of you. If you want to be a better partner, a healthy relationship has no master plan.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s what you both want it to be and it will keep changing as the time goes. A healthy relationship can also mean a recovering relationship. where you are both grow with the hope to be better partners. Understanding that it is a long-term thing, celebrating excellent times, and enduring good times and talking things out. The important goal is to satisfy a friendship and having meaningful moments.</p>



<p>It is difficult, but the commitment and the love you give each other is what will get you the long way. Once you fail to commit. You stand a chance to lose it all. You must never give up on a miracle. Your commitment must run deep. Hard things will happen you might lose a child, unable to pay bills, etc. but you must learn to appreciate what you have and learn to let go of the anger.</p>



<p>Staying together through hard times. Not forgetting to believe in God. if you introduce God into the relationship. You will help both of you, a few years later you will realize with commitment love can go along way. Forget what others think or will think. It will never be about them, but just you and your partner. Having the ability to meet your own needs and experience satisfaction. </p>

<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p class="has-text-color has-background has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-very-dark-gray-background-color">Accept the things you can&rsquo;t change. A healthy relationship is an exercise in acceptance and change. Relationships always change but better partners learn to hold the light embrace conflicts, resolve differences, and you will be fine.</p>

<h2>Finding your Vision</h2>



<p>We have talked about the number of tips. But now to find a Vision you must make a list and understand your vision. Talk about it and understand what you want to accomplish. While making your list, you must also talk about it with your partner. </p>



<p>How are you going to make decisions and solve problems? Because it&rsquo;s helpful to work out on Solutions together. Having a vision will make you a better partner and have hope. Your visions don&rsquo;t have to match. For example, your partner might like a small house. While you like the big house. But whichever you end up buying. The important thing is that you will still be together in that small or big house.</p>



<p>You can work on the differences over time. Save the list you have made. When you get into tough times revisit. you will see how helpful it is. Being better partners is something you must create together. Be honest and trust while you grow and change together.</p>



<h2>How will you get there</h2>



<p>This is your chance to learn fresh things about your love life. Forget what you have been told, but learn things on your own. Choose what means the world to you and your partner. Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>



<h3>Commitment</h3>



<p>Like I said above commitment is the first step in becoming better partners. But what it is? When you commit, let go of your previous experience, fear of failure, and the terrible things. Some confused commitment with</p>



<ul><li>medical benefits</li><li>child support</li><li>marriage vows</li><li>civil unions</li></ul>



<p>The paperwork has made us lose connection. We think of commitment as a legal document. But that, not the commitment. You can take all let out and still be committed. My purpose is to help you understand, all it takes is your good heart. If you commit, you are both deciding to be together, and face everything life throws at you so. One day you can be better partners, both of you don&rsquo;t know what will happen the following day. But whatever it is, you face that together. That why most people when they get married. You&rsquo;ll hear them saying for better or worse in the wedding vows. They know together, they can face anything.</p>



<h3>A road to Happy destiny</h3>



<p>Being better partners won&rsquo;t just happen. It results from growing together. Developing a new attitude and learning new skills. They allow girls in the family to grow up and leave the develop the necessary skills as children and be ready for a relationship. Girls grow up understanding what it&rsquo;s like to depend on others and them counting on you. They leave home with confidence and ready to engage in life. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/images-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-520" width="276" height="183"></figure></div>



<h2>&nbsp;Intimacy</h2>



<p>Most people use the word intimacy for sex. But it&rsquo;s also mean</p>



<ul><li>emotional</li><li>mental</li><li>spiritual nature of intimacy</li></ul>



<p>Intimacy is not something you will get from the relationship. Rather something you will bring. It will get deeper as time goes. You and your partner will share things that you can&rsquo;t tell anyone. Such as fear, insecurities, hopes, and disappointments. I tell you something about me; you tell me something about you.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to be together spending quality time. Like doing the garden, watching movies, even cuddling her in the chair. That connection is what you need to be better partners. Relying only on each other. enjoying friendship and activities making a life together vibrant.</p>



<p>Intimacy will become everyday living and sharing experiences. You don&rsquo;t need to share everything, you can share insights and awareness, living-learning, growing.</p>



<h3>What to expect</h3>



<ul><li>boundaries</li><li>awareness of self and others</li><li>curiosity</li><li>honesty</li><li>reachability</li><li>a spirit of forgiveness</li><li>openness to influence</li></ul>



<h2>Fighting, but fighting fair.</h2>



<p>Regardless of what relationship Style, most couples argue about the same things. The most common.</p>



<ul><li>money</li><li>sex</li><li>time</li><li>children</li><li>extended family</li></ul>



<p>These are the argument you can expect in almost every relationship. But what will make better partners is how you deal with these issues.</p>



<h3>Money fight</h3>



<p>Money fight Will represent lots of things in your relationship. including</p>



<ul><li>power</li><li>security</li><li>time</li><li>personal success</li><li>even love</li></ul>



<p>Most have become so confused about finance in the relationship. It also causing lots of breakup and disagreements.</p>



<p>We all have our own beliefs about money. It&rsquo;s hard to change them. But for a healthy relationship, you both need to talk about money and conclude. Once you talk about money. It will create honesty and relief. Knowing how much you must spend and how much is enough. But we live a lie, which makes the other partner have too high expectations.</p>



<h3>Fighting for time</h3>



<p>Men are the ones that rarely have time. I think it is how they grow up. They are never in, they are always out with friends.&nbsp; But for your road to a healthy relationship. You must learn to adapt if your partner moved out of her home just to be with you. The least you can do is to be available.</p>



<p>We all have time, the problem is how we spend it. They must be enough time for you, me, and the relationship. The less time you spend with your partner. Will make it hard for me to reach my goal. To make you better partners. Even when you are not together, taking your phone and checking up on your partner is important. </p>



<h3>Fighting over children</h3>



<p>Fights about children is the most destructive, yet people continue to do it. common if someone started being a parent while growing up. It&rsquo;s fair to say no one likes to hurt have children. But if you get a child without a plan, it might cause issues. Parenting must be a way to increase your relationship and the best thing you can do is prevented children if you are still not ready. If you get a Child by mistake, adapt to the situation, and give a child love. It will help with being better partners.</p>



<h3>Arguments about sex&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is funny, it makes me laugh that sex is in this list of the things we fight about. Women say in a relationship men want more sex. When the women say no, then that&rsquo;s when they put pressure on them. This results in a fight about sex. Which is not even fair? but I&rsquo;m not saying girls don&rsquo;t want too much sex. I think we will have to make an article on how to resolve sex issues. Because it&rsquo;s a broad topic. </p>



<h3>The extended family fights</h3>



<p>Our family in the relationship can be our best or worst. What I have noticed over the years. If your family sees that your relationship is solid, then that&rsquo;s when they move back and let you be. With the extended family fights, you need to set boundaries. You will have your own answers on when to draw the line and be responsible. Finding the balance between your extended family and your immediate family is difficult. Cause it differs from each family, but to be better partners you must find the balance.</p>



<h3>Some rules that might help you fight fair.</h3>



<p>The fight can be healthy and it doesn&rsquo;t mean just because you know this, you won&rsquo;t get into them. Follow these rules.</p>



<ul><li>avoided talking to each other while tempers are still high</li><li>once you cool down that&rsquo;s the perfect time to talk</li><li>if you talk, focus on one thing, stop talking about everything all at once</li><li>don&rsquo;t focus so much on who is right and wrong rather stick to finding the solution</li><li>respect each other&rsquo;s decisions and stick to what you agreed on.</li></ul>
