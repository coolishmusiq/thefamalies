<p>If you take a housewife. You must trust her to be a homemaker. That she will be by your side all the time.</p>



<p>Your job is to make sure she has enough money to buy things she likes whenever she like.</p>



<p>That a good thing, but sometimes that where the problem smart. Because you are working and she is at home, 247.</p>



<p>She does everything at home, but when she finishes, she might get bored and go out. If she goes out consistently without you since you are working.</p>



<p>Now there is a risk she might meet someone.</p>



<p>Women cheat as much as men do, but mostly for an emotional reason.</p>



<p>The sad part is that if you are working, it can take a long time. Before you even suspect your wife is cheating.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Smart-Graduation-Hat-PowerPoint-Templates-1024x576.jpg" alt="How do I catch a cheating housewife?" class="wp-image-671"><figcaption>How do I catch a cheating housewife?</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Signs your housewife is cheating</h2>



<ul><li>Her phone is always on silent.</li><li>She visits her family a lot.</li><li>She changed her passwords.</li><li>She accuses you of cheating.</li><li>She&rsquo;s asking to try new things in the bedroom.</li><li>She&rsquo;s ignoring you.</li><li>She gets mad at you about everything.</li></ul>



<p>If you see these signs, something can be wrong. But you need more than signs. </p>



<p>Now let look at the things you can do to catch your cheating housewife.</p>



<p>learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/why-cheaters-get-angry-when-caught-forgiving-a-cheater/">how cheaters reach if they get catch</a></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Act blind while suspecting your wife is cheating </h2>



<p>Even when you have started suspecting her. Don&rsquo;t ask her right away. </p>



<p>Get enough evidence, so that when you ask her. She can&rsquo;t fight it and tries to twist the truth.</p>



<p>She might say no, we are friends and if you don&rsquo;t have enough evidence. She will get away with it and try to be more careful the next time.</p>



<p>Act blind so she won&rsquo;t even know that you are after her games. </p>



<p>You must know what they have been doing. How long have they been doing it? Who is also involved!</p>



<p>Why you need all this? So, you will know if you can forgive or not. </p>



<p>the second reason so she can&rsquo;t get away with it and lie even more.</p>



<p>My point is you need solid proof.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Questions you should ask yourself about your cheating wife</h2>



<p>Before we go any further. You must ask yourself a few questions.</p>



<ul><li>What made you believe that something inappropriate is going on in your relationship? </li><li>How long do you suspect something has been going on?</li><li>Do you think the problem is getting better or worse?</li><li>What have you done so far to address and/or correct the problem?</li><li>How much would you say the situation has cost you so far? Emotionally, financially, and physically.</li><li>How much will it cost from here on out if you don&rsquo;t take some decisive action based on accurate?</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">High a private investigator&nbsp;for your homemaker</h2>



<p>A private investigator will have tools you don&rsquo;t have. </p>



<p>Some are even free and the perfect example is Uyajola99. This a TV show that has private investigators, and they can find out. What your partner has been doing while you were at work.</p>



<p>But the bad thing about Uyajola99, if they catch your wife. <strong>It will be live on TV.</strong></p>



<p>If you want some privacy, you still love your wife. Should hire a paid private investigator. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to dig yourself.</p>



<p>What also good about the private investigator. </p>



<p>After they have proof and solid evidence. They tell you on what you can do and what you can not do. </p>



<p>So, you don&rsquo;t end up in jail because you can.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Using mind control to catch a cheater</h2>



<p>How does this work? You start asking her question that can make her tell you the truth. </p>



<p>She will think you already know.</p>



<p>When in fact you didn&rsquo;t! you can ask her questions like what did you do last night? If she is guilty, she will want to know why you are asking.</p>



<p>You can continue with your mind game and say to her. It is funny how people can cheat on you and think you will never find out. </p>



<p>Again, if she is guilty, it will be hard for her to hide it. Because she will think you already know, in most cases she will break down and start telling you the truth.</p>



<p>But if she is not guilty, she will agree with your statement. </p>



<p>All you need are the right words, at the right time, to make your housewife think you already know everything.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Checking your spouse&rsquo;s phone</h2>



<p>If you can get your hands to her phone. Because you might know her password since she is your wife. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t look for the guy she is talking to. Most of the time that will be deleted frequently. But you must check the conversation with her friend.</p>



<p>Most girls have that one friend, that they tell everything and that good place to start. </p>



<p>Not only you might find who she is cheating with. You can also find why she is doing it.</p>



<p>Because girls share everything and all they talk about is men. Even when she regrets what she did, but doesn&rsquo;t know how to end the relationship. The only person she can tell is her friend. </p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Make use of technology</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Make-use-of-technology-1024x576.jpg" alt="Make use of technology" class="wp-image-672"></figure>



<p>Technology has come up with great tools. This can help you catch your cheating housewife. </p>



<p>You use things like<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/find-your-phone"> find my phone</a> to track where she is and tracking her alone won&rsquo;t give you a solid proof.</p>



<p>But you can track her phone. The second tip can be to use a flying drone to see what she is doing in that location and with who. How much time did she spend there?</p>



<p>If you get a good drone. it can take a video and take pictures from the distance. She won&rsquo;t even see there is a drown that following her. </p>



<p>Because she is your wife and you have the right to know the truth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-fly-a-drone">Learn how to fly a drone</a></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are other methods that you can use, like installing hidden cameras inside the house. The problem with that if she is doing everything outside the house, you won&rsquo;t find anything.</p>



<p>Your wife also knows even if you are at work. Neighbours can see her, and she can&rsquo;t trust them not to tell you.</p>



<p>The other method can be to ask her, but she might not tell the truth and up her game since you have suspicions.</p>



<p>You need to be careful about how are you planning to investigate. But I wish you find the truth and that after you find the truth, you take the right actions.</p>

<p>It is difficult to have a happy home. What makes this even harder, everyone understands happiness differently.</p>



<p>But who&rsquo;s job is it to make the family happy? The right answer is: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the job of every member of the family.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Mostly it falls on the shoulder of a mother and father, but everyone must play a part. If you think one person in your family must be responsible for family happiness. You are being unfair!</p>



<p>The family must do things together. This creates not only loyalty but a chance to build up and enjoy family affection.</p>



<p>Father and his wife must have a plan on how to keep family happy. The role must kids play. Because this won&rsquo;t just happen.</p>



<h2>Celebrate everything</h2>



<p>Little things matter! As a family, you have a lot to celebrate and you must celebrate all. Having a family is a delicate thing and should be promoted. This makes a positive difference and they must plan every celebration in time.</p>



<ul><li>Birthday</li><li>Anniversary</li><li>Kids pass at school</li><li>Christmas</li><li>New Year&rsquo;s Eve</li><li>Mother&rsquo;s Day</li><li>Father&rsquo;s Day</li><li>Life and more</li></ul>



<p>There is a lot to celebrate, and everyone needs to feel the love. A celebration will typically feature food and beverages, and music and dancing or other forms of entertainment. It&rsquo;s nice to be honoured as a person.</p>



<p>The person who is celebrated doesn&rsquo;t always have to know beforehand. You can organize a surprise party to the person in whose honour it is being held. </p>



<p>But it can also be a</p>



<ul><li>Block party</li><li>Dinner party</li><li>Graduation party</li><li>Housewarming party</li><li>Bridal shower</li><li>And more</li></ul>



<p>You just need to find what works for your family. Because each family celebrate differently, for example, for some families a block party can be a bit too much.</p>



<h2>Family need food lot of it</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-655"></figure>



<p>Food plays a huge role in keeping your family happy. In fact, this should be a priority for a good family. Without food, there is no happy family. We can own things like farms and gardens to help us provide for our families.</p>



<h3>Family garden</h3>



<p>I personally own a garden, Since I have learned to appreciate the value of gardening to better.</p>



<p>I love growing things, it can be vegetable, fruits, or flowers. This can be very helpful for your family wellbeing. You can decide what you want to plant in your garden. So you can feed your family.</p>



<p>Try to teach your kids at the early stage, the importance of growing food themselves.</p>



<p>You can get everything you want at the shop. But the vegetable from the shop can never be fresh as the ones coming straight from your own garden.</p>



<p>Besides the fact that vegetables give you good vitamins, you save money. Which can be used in other things. A large variety of vegetables and fruits can be stored in the pantries of our homes, and balanced meals can be served during the winter months and summer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>On your right hand is the picture of the garden. Which I and my wife own. even though we are working, we love getting vegetables straight from the garden whenever we can.</p>



<p>My wife loves cooking, and I love eating. We make sure we have for all the time. Even when we are broke, food is always available. </p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200827_180412-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-651"><figcaption>my garden </figcaption></figure>



<p></p>

<h3>Food shopping for everyone</h3>



<p>When doing food shopping you must think of everyone. If you have kids, you must know what they love. With providing for a family. The father must lead. However, every family member must contribute if they are working.</p>



<p>For the family to be happy everyone must play a role. It wise to do food shopping as a family. Just to make sure everyone has what he/she likes. Not only that, doing things together as a family is also a glorious experience on its own.</p>



<h2>Parent the right way</h2>



<p>Parents in the family must learn to parent the right way to keep the family. Most kids and teenagers go through different a thing and most are still learning how life works.</p>



<p>They might be at the stage where they think their parents are old-fashioned. Some think the parent knows nothing. Some think their parents treat them like babies.</p>



<p>As a parent, you must not forget that kids are growing up. So, you must understand them and help them grow. Kids need rules, but you must give them the right to talk about your rules.</p>



<p>They must know some behaviour is wrong. But don&rsquo;t force them to believe that right away. Kids have many questions in their heads, like</p>



<ul><li>Who am I?</li><li>Who can be my friend?</li><li>Who needs me?</li><li>Who can I be?</li></ul>



<p>Give them a chance to talk about themselves and help them feel good about themselves. For kids, to be happy they need to know their family cares for them.</p>



<p><strong>Praise them</strong></p>



<ul><li>when they help</li><li>when they are kind</li><li>and when they try</li></ul>



<h2>life satisfaction</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/life-satisfaction-1024x576.jpg" alt="life satisfaction" class="wp-image-656"></figure>



<p>Happiness can be defined differently depending on your culture. &nbsp;But in simple terms, it is the current experience of the&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;of emotion&nbsp;such as&nbsp;pleasure&nbsp;or&nbsp;joy,&nbsp;or of a more general sense of &rsquo;emotional condition.</p>



<p>Happiness can also be life satisfaction. A person&rsquo;s mood and viewpoint on life can also influence the insight into their own life satisfaction. For your family, to be happy. You must be believing in family and have hope.</p>



<p>The nice thing about a happy home. The happier family has a greater tendency to like others, which promotes a happier atmosphere.</p>



<p>Family life satisfaction is improved by the skill of family members together realizing their family standards. It is important to study family life satisfaction from all members of the family from a &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; viewpoint and an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; viewpoint.</p>



<h2>Keep your family safe from coronavirus</h2>



<p>Your family must be safe from coronavirus. If any family member gets COVID 19, this can be dangerous and ruin family happiness.</p>



<p>Since it can pass from one member to another in no time. It important for you to teach your family self-care, wash hands and wearing a mask in public.</p>



<p>Until there is a vaccine. We must do our best to protect those we love during this time.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Having a happy family is nice. But don&rsquo;t think it will be like that every day. That not reasonable. Your family will still go through challenges like everyone else. If you love each other and stay together everything will be fine. <strong>I wish your family a happy life and don&rsquo;t stop loving one another.</strong></p>

<p>A housewife is a married woman who is not working outside the home. Housewife takes care of everything at home. If she has kids, a housewife can also be called a stay-home mother. However, not every housewife has kids.</p>



<p>Some people also call her a homemaker. Because she manages everything at her home.</p>



<ul><li>caring for her children</li><li>buying</li><li>cooking</li><li>storing food for the family</li><li>buying goods that the family needs for everyday life</li><li>housekeeping</li><li>cleaning and maintaining the home&nbsp;</li><li>buying and/or mending clothes for the family</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Should-you-be-housewife-Pros-and-cons.pptx-1024x576.jpg" alt="Should you be housewife Pros and cons" class="wp-image-638"></figure>



<p>We will look at what a housewife does later. A housewife is not employed outside the home. However, some do work from home. Housewife works many hours at home and her husband supports her financially.</p>



<p>Understand homemakers differ, for example, homemakers from rural are responsible for gardens and more. While in the urban area it is very rare, they might own the garden.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Nice things about being a housewife</h2>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">kids</h3>



<p>Most women love to be around their kids and stay-home moms give them just that. Their kids don&rsquo;t have to be raised by someone else just because mom is always working.</p>



<p>Homemakers don&rsquo;t have to worry about office stress. Because working nowadays can be stressful. Especially if you have kids.</p>



<p>If you are a housewife, you have a chance to prepare kids for school, make lunch for them, take them to school and fetch them later. You have a gift to watch your kids grow right in front of you. You are also responsible for most decisions.</p>



<h4 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Housewife with no kids</h4>



<p>It is possible you might not have kids at the beginning of your marriage. But you can still be the best homemaker, even you don&rsquo;t have kids. Just focusing on your husband pleasure and yours.</p>



<p>Besides, thinking about your husband all the time. You can also read books or watch Netflix during the day. You know what you love.</p>



<p>Even without kids there are always plenty of things to do at home.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Working for home</h3>



<p>Just because you stay home doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t work from home. Even though most housewives choose to enjoy their time and only focus on home duties. Which is fine, but you can also try to work from home during your spare time.</p>



<p>However, I advise you to talk to your husband first before you start working from home.</p>



<ul><li>You can start a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_transcription">medical transcription</a> service which involves transcribing audio or video reports from healthcare professionals into text format. It the simple job that can be done home and pays well.</li><li>Affiliate for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>, you can open a website. Start selling and earn a commission. &nbsp;While this is competitive especially if you are starting out. If done right, you can get good cash.</li><li>Start a blog. You can start blogging, maybe talk about the parenting-related topic and earn money through <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/">AdSense</a>. Most moms start this by doing it for fun and end up making serious cash.</li><li>Become a YouTuber and you can teach women how to be an excellent housewife. Like blogging, you will earn money through ads.</li><li>Invest in stocks. Save a little in stocks every month, you will be suppressed over time how much you can make if you manage your risk well and take proper classes.</li></ul>



<p>There is a lot you can do at home in your spare time. You just need to find what fits your style and do that. I can not choose for you because I&rsquo;m not a financial advisor. Just helping you understand there is a lot that you can do.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Things you can do all day as a homemaker</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Things-you-can-do-all-day-as-homemaker-1024x576.jpg" alt="Things you can do all day as homemaker" class="wp-image-643"></figure>



<ul><li>Make a small garden, have few vegetables</li><li>Cleaning/vacuuming the home</li><li>Prepare for a dog and a cat if you have any</li><li>Watch tv maybe some news</li><li>Check what need in the house and go do some shopping</li><li>Check up on your family during the day</li><li>Take care of kids</li><li>Go online, learn about cooking then prepare nice food for later</li><li>Wash dishes</li><li>Kiss your husband, make him happy in bed</li><li>Breastfeed if you have a newborn</li><li>Teach kids and play with them</li></ul>



<p>What you do a homemaker will depend on your style. Moms love different things so will you, but your responsibility is to make a husband happy.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Common housewife issues.</h2>



<p>Women tend to complain men put so much pressure on them. Forgetting wife is someone you love, not a machine. It gives women stress, sometimes that men expect them to do all the work, have kids, and later the man is looking for sex.</p>



<p>However, even though this all sounds reasonable. A woman always has a choice. It not like she is forced. It is a decision they make with her husband.</p>



<p>Homemaker is not independent as a career woman. There is a risk if her husband dies, she won&rsquo;t be able to provide for the kids. Her lack of a work history means that she can&rsquo;t get a job.</p>



<p>Another issue has to do with the husband losing the job. Now both are not working with kids to take off. Even if they don&rsquo;t have kids if they both home without the proper income it can be the issue.</p>



<p>Marriage, in the long run, can turn abusive. Some men can think because they give you money, they own you. So, they might expect you to be perfect all the time. Worse, you have to move out of your home so you are stuck with him.</p>



<p>Now, this does not mean don&rsquo;t be a housewife. But make sure you choose a good man that you have known for many years. Because it is a big decision.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Should you have a college degree as a housewife?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Should-you-have-college-degree-as-housewife-1024x576.jpg" alt="Should you have college degree as housewife" class="wp-image-645"></figure>



<p>Most definitely if you can get one. Even though you might never use your degree but it is there as security or insurance. A degree gives you a security to do what you need to do in unforeseen circumstances. Just in case things don&rsquo;t go as planned, you can start afresh and be independent.</p>



<p>Being educated also changes how you choose your lifestyle. Some degrees can be used at home. Maybe you end up starting a small business indoor.</p>



<p>No one can take your education from you. Maybe in the long run, if you have many kids. It can get hard for a husband to provide alone. You may need to work.</p>



<p>Education is for knowledge not only for job/salary but for your own development.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Develop good habits for yourself and your husband. Have a routine and be disciplined. Maintain your health, do the gym, look nice. Don&rsquo;t rely on domestic helpers, do most work yourself. It is your home, it needs your love and attention.</p>



<p>Go to church and love your kids.</p>

<p>We all have our own experience of cheating and being cheated on. But we sometimes get confused if we confront someone who cheated. Instead of them feeling sorry for what they did, they get angry on us.</p>



<p>Why is this and how to deal with it? Most of the time, if you cheat. You are aware of what will happen if you get caught. Most people will just break up with you if they catch you.</p>



<p>So, once a cheater realizes you know, they try to cover up with the lies. If they don&rsquo;t have the answer to your question that when they get mad and frustrated. Then try to overpower your questions with violent actions.&nbsp;So, you can stop asking them about their wrongdoings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-cheaters-get-angry-when-caught.jpg" alt="Why cheaters get angry when caught?" class="wp-image-625"></figure>



<p>Sometimes, they are not even angry. They act angry to be defensive. Defensiveness is often a good sign that someone has something to hide.</p>



<p>Most people don&rsquo;t want you to tell them they are wrong. They prefer you to leave them alone if you think they are wrong. If you continue to force answers on them. That pisses them off.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Should you forgive a cheater?</h2>



<p>Only forgive a cheating person if you still love them, and they are sorry. Understand if you are trying to leave someone who cheated, but you still love them. It will block you from loving the next person.</p>



<p>But if your partner cheats, and they don&rsquo;t ask forgiveness. They don&rsquo;t love and respect you enough, don&rsquo;t stay in that relationship. Move on a find someone who will value you. You may take a few months and stop dating. Give your self-time to heal and to be ready for the next relationship.</p>



<p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Don&rsquo;t start a new relationship with the anger from the past relationship.</span></p>



<p>If you still love them and planning to forgive them. You must understand, why did they cheat on you, because you may be the reason. If you are the reason. Sit down with them and talk about it. Come up with the solution.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Do cheaters always cheat again?</h2>



<p>Understanding if your partner will cheat again or not. Will depend on why he/she cheated. Was it because he/she felt negated or did he/she feel starving or seeking excitement, etc.</p>



<p>People cheat for different reasons. Understanding those reasons will give you a hint if they will cheat again.</p>



<p>Because someone is giving you the reason why he/she cheated. Does not mean what he/she did was right.</p>



<p>You must always talk about your problem in a relationship. If you can&rsquo;t find a solution. You must end the relationship and move on.</p>



<p>I can not give a single answer on whether a person will cheat on you. Because it defers from each relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Signs he/she might cheat again</h3>



<ul><li>No apology or say sorry, you can stop asking him/her questions.</li><li>A cheater doesn&rsquo;t want to listen to you. This is a sign he/she doesn&rsquo;t regret his/her action.</li><li>Cheated with more than one person.</li><li>If they cannot disclose why they cheated</li><li>Blame his action, not himself. Example (I was drunk)</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">How do you know a cheater is sorry?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-do-you-know-a-cheater-is-really-sorry.jpg" alt="How do you know a cheater is really sorry" class="wp-image-626"></figure>



<p>Now how do you know if a cheater is sorry? In case, you were thinking about forgiving him or her.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Distance yourself a minute and see if the cheater is coming after you. If they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t care about the relationship.</li><li>Did your partner break the relationship with the person he/she cheated with? Are they still communicating? If yes, then he/she does not feel sorry at all.</li><li>Your partner must adapt to your needs.</li><li>They won&rsquo;t pressure you to &ldquo;get over it&rdquo; before you&rsquo;re ready to do so.</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">When wrongfully accused of cheating</h2>



<p>What if the reason for your partner to get angry, if you ask him/her about cheating, is because they didn&rsquo;t do it? That can happen when you think they did it, but they did not.</p>



<p>They have accused me of cheating several times. While I wasn&rsquo;t cheating and it is the worst feeling. People react differently, some can be furious if you call them cheaters. While they have been loyal to you.</p>



<p>In the worst case, you might not find out you were wrong. This can ruin a relationship if not end it. Make sure before you accuse your partner of cheating that you have proof. All your sources for accusation are solid.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">How does a guilty person act when accused?</h3>



<p>Now let us say you don&rsquo;t have enough proof to tell if they cheated or not. How they react will tell if they are guilty or not. </p>



<p>The most common sign is that they try to justify everything. They usually cannot answer your question and involve a lot of things under one question.</p>



<p>If you didn&rsquo;t do it, why would you even care that much about being in details? Not only they justify everything. But they get emotional too. They think you want to fight them, even if you were asking in a good-mannered.</p>



<p>After that, it becomes hard for them to sleep because they are guilty and still trying to come up with solutions. It like something is eating them.</p>



<p>They also avoid spending time with you and the eye contact. They might even ignore your call cause they fear you will ask them questions.</p>



<p>That how you know they are guilty and hiding something.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Cheating ruins a relationship</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cheating-ruins-a-relationship.jpg" alt="Cheating ruins a relationship" class="wp-image-627" width="720" height="405"></figure></div>



<p>Cheating is the worst thing you can do to someone you love. It&rsquo;s something you should never do, and it is very painful.</p>



<p>After you cheat on someone it changes the way they look at you. They don&rsquo;t trust you anymore, and they now see you as a lie. Can they recover from that? Yes, but it will take time, a very long time.</p>



<p>If you cheat, not only you disappoint your partner. But you disappoint everyone. Your family, your partner family, kids,&hellip;everyone. Because once you grow, we expect you to be responsible and do the right things.</p>



<p>Worse, it takes years to rebuild. So why cheat? Let not forget you stand a chance to lose a relationship. That would mean you wasted all those years building a relationship for nothing.</p>



<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t lose a relationship, you can still get STI. Now you and your partner are sick just because you couldn&rsquo;t be responsible.</p>



<p>Cheating ruin a relationship and it goes deeper than you think.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish you can someone who loves you and respects you the way you want. Who never even tries to cheat on you. Because you deserve better than that. Being in love is a blessing, and to be loved by someone <a href="http://What%20does%20it%20mean%20to%20love%20someone%20so%20much%20it%20hurts?">who never wants to lose you</a> is what we all fight for. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, distance can kill a relationship. Though you can talk every day over the phone. Lack of physical interaction can be a problem.&nbsp;Communicating can help, but does not solve all problems.</p>



<p>If you are in love with a person who validates physical interaction. The more time you spend apart, the more they will lose value. Walking hand in hand with your partner means a lot for some people, chatting all day doesn&rsquo;t do much for them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide1-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Can distance kill a relationship?" class="wp-image-599"></figure>



<p>If you miss your partner and say &ldquo;I wish I was there&rdquo; that can be a pleasant thing to say but not for long. If you say that over and over. Then it gets annoying!</p>



<p>Movies make long-distance looks so simple, but in actual life it complicated. Words need to be followed by actions. Words alone won&rsquo;t get far. Spending time with your partner is priceless.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Traveling cost</h2>



<p>Traveling costs also play a huge role in killing long-distance relationships. If you must pay high fees to visit someone every month. Over time, you realize you can cover a lot of things with that money.</p>



<p>My advice if you can pay high traveling fees just to see that one person. The best you can do is just move with them.</p>



<p>You will save money and all that long-distance drama.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Living without sex</h2>



<p>While one can stay without sex, the longer you stay without it. The more you will think your partner is doing it with someone else. The common issue with girls they like to accuse their boyfriends of cheating with 0 evidence.</p>



<p>Living without sex will also increase the chances of unnecessary fights. You can live without sex, but it won&rsquo;t be a happy life.</p>



<p>Sex is many things in a relationship. If you both cannot do sex because of the distance. This means you might lose the chance of having children in time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too far for my hands to hold you, but too near for my heart to love you.&rdquo;</span></p><cite>&ndash;&nbsp;Heraline</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Life changes</h2>



<p>Life has changed a lot over the years. Technology has changed the long-distance game. Even though you can use <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> or <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Hangouts</a>, for video chat it&rsquo;s still nothing compared to a dinner and movie date.</p>



<p>Tech has given long-distance partners the chance to talk 24.7, while this sounds like a grand thing. But talking every day and meet once in a while actually might have a negative effect on relationships.</p>



<p>In a short-term technology can save a long-distance relationship, but in the long term, it does more harm than good.</p>



<p>It hard to maintain the long distance with or without technology.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Signs your long distance is dying</h2>



<p>Although we don&rsquo;t like long-distance. We can&rsquo;t run away from the fact someone is still involved. How can you see if your relationship is at risk?</p>



<p>This is important in long-distance because you might wait for someone who has moved on. If you see this sign, it can help to end a relationship before things get ugly.</p>



<ul><li>Every conversation is turning in to an argument.</li><li>Reducing communication time over the phone.</li><li>Delaying the dates for the visits.</li><li>When you meet your partner, it feels like you are with a stranger.</li><li>Losing hope in a relationship.</li><li>No one is willing to compromise.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&nbsp;<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">&ldquo;If you found that one person who is really worth the sacrifices, pain, and hardships, then your efforts will not go to waste.&rdquo; </span></p><cite>&ndash; Anna Agoncillo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Third option</h2>



<p>We know the most long-distance relationships won&rsquo;t work. For this reason, most people keep options open while in a relationship since most relationships often fail.</p>



<p>If your partner thinks he/she is attractive, they think about the third option. Then just long-distance relationship. The distance can work for a few months, but as your partner has the second or third option. The risk in your relationship grown big time.</p>



<p>Especially when time gets hard, people give up easily in long-distance. Then in just a normal relationship. Having a negative thought about the relationship is enough to kill the relationship.</p>



<p>But in long-distance confusion and fear of wasting your time can be the feelings that you can&rsquo;t run from.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">How do I keep a distance from ruining my relationship?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="How do I keep distance from ruining my relationship?" class="wp-image-601"></figure>



<p>Long-distance is very complicated and will need you both to be loyal, trust, and believe in each other. Most long-distance fail in a year or fast than that, however, some can make it work even though it difficult.</p>



<p>These are the thing that can help your relationship during long-distance</p>



<ul><li><strong>Get married </strong>people to respect the ring more, even when you are away.</li><li><strong>Send pictures, </strong>make it a habit to send pictures every time you take new ones. If you both have kids, also send pictures for kids too.</li><li><strong>Talk constantly, but not always. </strong>The mistake people do is to think just because there are on long-distance now, they must talk every day. Don&rsquo;t only talk when it makes sense.</li><li>If you are both in a long distance because of work. One of you must <strong>try to get a work transfer as soon as possible.</strong></li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t say things you can&rsquo;t say face to face over the phone.</strong> Respect your partner just because they are now far doesn&rsquo;t mean you must say bad things over the phone you can&rsquo;t tell in person.</li><li><strong>Send gifts and followers.</strong> Just because you far do not mean you can&rsquo;t send gifts home. Technology is very helpful if used the right way. You can even buy lunch using <a href="https://www.mrdfood.com/">MR D</a> or <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/za">UberEATS</a> for your partner while you are not around.</li><li><strong>See it as an opportunity. </strong>While you are in a distance, focus on self-development. You can start learning, get a driver&rsquo;s license, etc. Don&rsquo;t just sit and wait for your partner, develop yourself.</li><li><strong>Have rules. </strong>Most people skip this part, but it is necessary. For example, can one date while in the distance or can they use things like sex toys? You need to have rules and commit to them.</li><li><strong>Avoid dirty talk. </strong>Most people think because you are far now you must send nudes and talk dirty constantly. But doing that will make you wish for sex if you can&rsquo;t get it. That when frustrations kick in.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be selfish and careless</strong>. What do I mean by that? I mean going out with friends and late-night drinks. While your partner is not doing any of that and patiently waiting for you.</li><li><strong>Have a goal you both want to achieve.</strong></li><li><strong>You must know when the distance will end.</strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><strong> No relationship can stay on </strong>long-distance forever</span>. So, it must be clear when it is going to end.</li><li><strong>Know each other&rsquo;s schedules. </strong>This can be helpful because you will know when to call and not to.</li><li><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/how-do-you-express-love-to-your-family/"><strong>Spend more time with your family.</strong> </a>While your partner is away trying to be available to your family and his.</li><li><strong>Discuss how you deal with pressure</strong>. You both in a long-distance pressure will be there, discuss how you deal with it.</li><li><strong>Talk about big issues in person, avoid them over the phone</strong>.</li><li><strong>Visit often even when you don&rsquo;t have money. </strong>The other mistake people do is to think they only need to go home when they got paid. If you have money for transport, go home your company will mean more.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t ignore your instincts if you think something is wrong, pay attention.</strong></li></ul>

<p>How do you express your love to your family members? Do you give them a gift? Do you give them a back scratch? Do you tell them you really appreciated something they did? Do you schedule a special time in your day? </p>



<h2><strong>Love your parents</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide7-1024x576.jpg" alt="love your parent jpg" class="wp-image-579" width="206" height="115"></figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Before you love anyone else in your family start with your parents. Respect them and give them love. No one in your family will love you if you are mean to your parents.</p>



<p>Develop a positive attitude toward your parents. They are the reason you even have a family. You may disagree with what your parents tell you from time to time.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p> </p>



<p></p>



<p>Please! <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">If you disagree with them, don&rsquo;t be rude about it.</span></strong></p>



<p>Spend time with them, even if you have your own place. Visit your parents and spend time with them.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Family comes first</span></h2>



<p>Most blessings we get depend on the relationship we have with our family&rsquo;s. If you are someone that believes in God like me. Before you ask anything on God do good for your family first.  You must always be reliable, don&rsquo;t make promises you can&rsquo;t keep. </p>



<p>The pleasant thing about the family, you don&rsquo;t have to pretend to be someone that you are not. They know you and they love you the way you are. </p>



<h2>Positive mental attitude</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-581" width="531" height="299"></figure></div>



<p>A lot of things will happen in our families. Always try to keep a positive mental attitude whenever you can. Embrace life even when you have obstacles. </p>



<p>Life becomes unfair and hard for all of us. But if you keep a positive attitude, your family will appreciate you even more. </p>



<p>Why you shouldn&rsquo;t have a negative mental attitude in your family? If you have a negative attitude, you think worse of everything.</p>



<p>Even if your family loves you, your mind can make you believe they don&rsquo;t. It also makes smaller problem to become bigger problems.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Take your kids out</span></h2>



<p>Kids love going out but they can&rsquo;t because we as parents are the only ones with that power to take them out. </p>



<p>It always nice to take your kids out to different places so they can explore. You can all go out as a family with your husband and kids. </p>



<p>Do lunch, maybe go to a mini-town because kids love mini-towns. </p>



<div class="wp-block-cover alignwide has-background-dim-20 has-background-dim has-custom-content-position is-position-bottom-left" style="background-image:url(https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-13.jpg);background-position:40% 26%;min-height:332px"><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="line-height:1.1;font-size:74px;color:#fffffa"><strong>Mini-town</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>But mini-town are not the only places kids enjoy. You can do your own research based on your location.</p>



<h2>Be there when your presence is required</h2>



<p>Sometimes your presence is enough. Families don&rsquo;t always require you to bring something. Just be there when they need you that enough. </p>



<p>Some family members choose to stay away, maybe because of unpleasant experiences which happened in the past. </p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Be loyal</span></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-573"></figure>



<p>Loyalty is everything home, work, and in a relationship.&nbsp; So, for your family to take you more seriously, you must stand for your words and avoid breaking promises.</p>



<p>You must be loyal to your family, which can also mean to be faithful. Try to provide them with what makes them happy. If you are lucky to have a job, you must put it in mind that you work for your family.</p>



<p>You must stand for your brother and sister and the entire family if they are in trouble. Give your family emotional support and improve your loyalty.</p>



<p>Loyalty is something which we teach ourselves, and over time we get better at it. Don&rsquo;t forget your family also needs spiritual support.</p>



<h2>Understand family moods</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-574" width="186" height="105"></figure></div>



<p>They will test your loyalty several times in your family. Family moods are very common and you need a plan to deal with them.</p>



<p>Some family member doesn&rsquo;t like to be told what to do and not to do. That way you might request them to do something for you and that when the moods kick in.</p>



<p>But they can be moody for several reasons, I&rsquo;m just making an example. Since moods are changed by a lot of things.</p>



<p>It wise to give your family members space if you see they are not in a good mood. Talk to them later, once they cool off. There is nothing wrong with bad moods. No one feels cheerful all the time. Just try not to make things worse.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Know what your family love</span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-575"></figure></div>



<p>Different families love uncommon things, some love music, fishing, braai day, some movies, etc. To express love to your family you must know what they love as the entire family and individuals.</p>



<p>You will also need to know the birth date for each member. This can help you with arranging a surprise party and buying gifts in time.</p>



<p>Holiday times like Christmas are hard if you don&rsquo;t know what your family likes.</p>



<h2>Help one another</h2>



<p>While every family can be different, most families depend on one another and help one another.</p>



<p>Families come in different sizes, your family might be big or small. However, if you want to express love to your family.</p>



<p>Teach them to help one another and be a leading example. What really makes a family is the love, care, and concern that members show for one another.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Be surprising</span></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide5-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-577"></figure>



<p>Don&rsquo;t allow yourself to do the same thing over and over. Learn new things. The family loves surprises. &nbsp;If you do pleasant things for them don&rsquo;t expect them to do the same. Just do things out of your go hearth.</p>



<p>Yes, some will return the favor but don&rsquo;t expect it from them.</p>



<h2>Buy Gifts</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slide6-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-578" width="187" height="105"></figure></div>



<p>Gifts are the obvious and popular way to express love to your family.&nbsp; But not all of buying them. You need to learn the language of gifts. The fact we are not born with a giving nature or you were not given enough present growing up. Does not mean you must not buy a present for your family.</p>



<p>But don&rsquo;t give a gift for the wrong reasons. Wrong reasons can be to compete with other givers in your family or to earn a reputation as a giver.</p>



<p>Many people give in order to feed their egos. Which is not cool you must always buy a gift for the right reason. The major reason is to express love.</p>



<h2><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Conclusion</span></h2>



<p>Just express love to your family any way you can. Family is a gift on its own, appreciate that while you can. Your family needs your commitment and love. Show up if need and be there for each other, never give up on them.</p>



<p>Family is not only important but also everything. No family is perfect, every family spends time apart but makes time if needed. Forget about everything else, just go home, and love your family.</p>

<p>As adults, we are conditioned to encourage our children to share their toys, food, or anything else they have in their possession. Teaching our kids to share not on help our kids, but it also makes us <a href="http://How%20to%20be%20better%20partners">better partners.</a></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Helping-Your-Children-Learn-To-Share-1024x576.jpg" alt="Helping Your Children Learn To Share" class="wp-image-532"></figure></div>



<h2>Why is sharing important for a child</h2>



<p>Kids are born blank and they don&rsquo;t understand what is happening to the world. So they need our help to understand what right and what is wrong. Most kids cry if they want something, that because we teach them if they cry they will get what they want. </p>



<p>However, if the kid cry yet, they don&rsquo;t get what they want. Eventually, kids change their focus to something else.</p>



<p>We may not even question why our kids should share, other than it&rsquo;s the proper thing to do. It is much easier to teach them to share at the early stage than when they are adults.</p>



<p>Children don&rsquo;t naturally share their possessions, it&rsquo;s a behavior that is learned. It&rsquo;s a wonderful social skill, provided that sharing is taught from the perspective of abundance and spreading love as opposed to lack and sacrifice. </p>



<p>When kids reach the age of 2+ everything seems to become an issue.</p>



<p>Sharing Is A Learned Behaviour. Most babies will play with what is in front of them. If we take it off them, we may upset them. </p>



<p>But most of the time they will just play with something else.  If another child takes a toy off them, it is a full-blown tantrum. </p>



<p>Around the age +2 years is the best time to teach your kids to share.</p>



<h2>What do you do when your child won&rsquo;t share?</h2>



<p>If you give your kid something else to play with, this will usually solve the problem.</p>



<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t work for some kids, so what should you do?</p>



<p>Understanding your child needs to strengthen and build connections. Sometimes the best you can do is not to intervene. </p>



<p>Give your child the chance to learn to socialize. Because as parent sometime we are quick to jump to conclusion and try to resolve things and don&rsquo;t let our kids work out their own strategies.</p>



<p>But monitor them closely to make sure they don&rsquo;t fight. Over time, your child might learn the skill to share without you taking action.</p>



<p>The following video explains more about what I was talking about and gives you additional tips on what you can do if your kids won&rsquo;t share.</p>



<iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TEAJqIB63Nc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<h2>How Do Children Learn To Share?</h2>



<p>Children learn most things from their parents. This means if they see you doing something. They will copy the same. A parent needs to be a leading example in everything they want their children to do or to become.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote" style="border-color:#fcb900"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color"><p>Monkey see monkey do: Model behavior in early childhood</p><cite>according to <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/monkey_see_monkey_do_model_behavior_in_early_childhood">Michigan State University</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mainly it is a by the example of others and actively showing and guiding them on how to. As your child grows older, you can reason with them and they also understand more of the situation. When they are young, you may sometimes need to intervene.</p>



<p>You can model sharing behavior at home, share your snacks with your partner, share your cuddles with the family, or if you have a special treat, that you want to share, &nbsp;by all means, share!</p>

<h2>why is sharing so important?</h2>



<p>Learning to share can be tricky for kids, but it a vital life skill. Not only they will use that skill in their childhood, but they will need it as adults. </p>



<p>It can be at work or relationship, even in school.  <strong>If you don&rsquo;t have the skill to share, it&rsquo;s hard to make and keep friends.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sharing is caring</strong> if you teach your kids to share, not only they learn to share. But they also learn to care for other at the early stage.</p>



<h2>Sharing Creates Harmony</h2>



<p>If a child takes a toy away from another child, you must give the toy back to the child and explain that someone is already playing with it. They can have it after they have finished. For the child that does not have the toy, you can redirect them to a similar or another toy for them to play with. After some time they will become better at this.</p>



<p>I normally make an exception on this rule if the toy is special and acknowledge it was my fault for leaving it out while other children were about. Having a security teddy bear or blanket or something else picked up and played with can be upsetting to a child. Even I would get upset or anxious&nbsp;if someone started messing around with my favorite possessions.</p>



<p>When a toy is taken from a child and their parent says let the other child have it you have played with it for long enough or you need to learn about sharing, this is sending a lot of wrong messages to the child such as you must stop what you are doing to accommodate for others as you are not important enough.</p>



<p>If another child really wants a toy, you can try encouraging your child to share and describing what this is all about. It is up to you to determine whether they are at a point they will understand the situation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/children-studying-togetherness-boys-preview.jpg" alt="kids sharing the book." class="wp-image-247"></figure>



<h2>Sharing Isn&rsquo;t About Sacrifice, It&rsquo;s About Spreading Goodwill</h2>



<p>The main point I wanted to get across is that sharing isn&rsquo;t about sacrificing for someone else and teaching your children this. There is normally a way to get both children to be happy and to encourage your child to share for the right reasons of making someone else happy or realizing that they can let someone else play with something and it will be available for them to play with later.</p>



<h2>Teach Abundance And Sharing Becomes Easy</h2>



<p>When children are sharing such things as food make sure there is plenty more if needed. Teach your child there is more than enough to go around and back this up if needed.</p>



<p>This will ensure they aren&rsquo;t entering sharing situations with a sense that they must get as much as they can because otherwise they will miss out.</p>

<p>I recently had the horrifying, gut-wrenching experience of thinking my child had disappeared. </p>



<p>Our middle son managed to open the locked front door and go for a wander up to our street. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful that our street is a quiet street, and that there is virtually no traffic. </p>



<p>However, there is nothing more terrifying than those moments where you run through the possible scenarios of what could happen to your precious baby.</p>



<p>Here, my child had gone next door to visit our lovely neighbour, who upon discovering her little visitor, immediately called me to ask if I knew he was there.</p>



<p>Little master 2.5 had a chat about not sneaking out without telling his mommy where he was going, and I installed a few extra precautions on the front door locks. (It did cross my mind to lo-jack the boy)</p>



<p>What sprung to mind was how grateful I was to have an attentive and considerate neighbour who had my phone number, and knew to call me.</p>



<p>We are living in a world where the community isn&rsquo;t what it used to be. We&rsquo;re more connected online than we are to our neighbours in our streets.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on this experience, and a business book that I teach my coaching clients. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful book by<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Well-Before-Youre-Thirsty/dp/0385485468"> Harvey McKay called &ldquo;Dig Your Well Before You&rsquo;re Thirsty&rdquo;</a> and it&rsquo;s designed for business owners, but very apt for anyone.</p>



<p>The message in the book is to ensure that when the worst should happen, you&rsquo;re prepared, and have a network of trusted people you can call on for assistance.</p>



<p>When we first moved into our neighbourhood, I made a point of introducing myself to our neighbours. </p>



<p>Some are lovely, others I&rsquo;m not so close with, but I&rsquo;m ever so grateful today that I have a relationship with our street.</p>



<p>There are several key relationships that I feel every family should nurture and have in place:</p>



<h2>At least one good friend that you could &nbsp;call at 2am</h2>



<p>I&rsquo;ve always said if you can count your close friends, on one hand, you&rsquo;re very blessed. </p>



<p>Every mother, every family, should have at least one special, supportive, through a thick and thin friend who they can call on at 2 am.</p>



<p>In situations of joy, and in situations of agony, there is nothing like a good friend.</p>



<p>The best way to make a friend is to be a friend. Who trusts you enough to call on you at 2 am?</p>



<h2>A wonderful, understanding, supportive health care provider</h2>



<p>Having a health care provider whose wisdom you can innately trust is invaluable. </p>



<p>My family is incredibly blessed to have the care of a wonderful chiropractor and naturopath. Whose care has been incredible, but more importantly, their collective wisdom and advice has proved repeatedly to be something we couldn&rsquo;t live without.</p>



<h2><strong>An excellent educator for your children</strong></h2>



<p>Your child&rsquo;s education is what gives them the tools to be, do, and have anything they choose in their lives. </p>



<p>A wonderful educator will help your child be empowered to create the life of their dreams.</p>



<p>That educator might well be you, in which case, who are your educators and mentors? Who is helping you grow and realise your own dreams and ambitions?</p>



<h2>An excellent accountant to assist you with your financial security</h2>



<p>As someone who is not motivated by money, it&rsquo;s very reassuring for me to know that my financial affairs are well looked after and that we are slowly but surely building up a nest egg to protect us in our old age.</p>



<p>I know that if the worst should happen, my children will be provided for. I know that if the best should happen, we&rsquo;re set to retire comfortably.</p>



<h2>Your close neighbours and community</h2>



<p>As I&rsquo;ve proved today, my neighbours are a blessing. They&rsquo;ve been a blessing on over one occasion. When I was in a car accident, and couldn&rsquo;t get hold of my darling wife on her phone, it was my neighbours who notified her of what happened, and that I was OK.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve been there for our neighbours too when washing machines have broken down, we&rsquo;ve assisted with putting through a few loads of washing.</p>



<p>There have been countless cups of coffee and wonderful chats. perhaps a little of indulgent gossip about neighbourhood goings-on, and lots of over the fence catch-ups.</p>



<p><strong>Neighbours are a blessing.</strong></p>



<p>So dig yours well before you thirsty. You&rsquo;ll never know when you must call on the relationships in your life to help you out of a sticky situation.</p>



<h2>Being friends</h2>



<p>Even if you recently bought a house, you need that one good friend. Someone you can talk to and advise one another on how to deal with certain issues facing your community. </p>



<p>Sharing will increase your knowledge about the place you currently live in. Also, create a healthy environment for your family around the area.</p>

<p>These are my top ten natural parenting tips for new parents. If only I had known&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100418022757im_/https://www.naturalparentingtips.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/things-i-wish-i-knew.jpg" alt="10 Things I Wish I Knew Before I Was A Parent" class="wp-image-663"></figure>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">1. <strong>They Aren&rsquo;t Out To Manipulate You</strong></h2>



<p>This means your baby doesn&rsquo;t cry his/her little eyes out because they are just trying to get attention or manipulate you in some way. They are either hungry, sleepy, uncomfortable (wet nappy/diaper, hot/cold) or bored. </p>



<p>Figure which one it is and they stop. Even if you have just changed their diaper 2 minutes ago, check again, I have been caught out before. Go through each one and you will get it.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>2.&nbsp;Talk Your Child Through Everything</strong></h2>



<p>Even if they can&rsquo;t speak yet or you don&rsquo;t think they even understand a word you are saying, just say it anyway. You will&nbsp;find things go a lot&nbsp;easier. </p>



<p>I have found this even works when I am putting down a completely asleep toddler, but need to change&nbsp;him first. </p>



<p>If I&nbsp;say everything I do&nbsp;before I do it, he stays asleep and even wriggles around to make it easier for me.</p>



<p>it create a connection at the early stage that will last forever.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t Bother About The Perfect Looking House</strong></h2>



<p>Maybe when they are 10 years or older, you could keep a reasonably tidy house, but before then prepare for food everywhere, toys and dirt. </p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t bother resisting it, go with the flow. They are a few things you can do though. Eat outside as often as possible. Use toy rotation in your toy room, and a big chest to store all the toys. Keep your re-flooring and expensive furniture until afterwards.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>4.&nbsp;Covers</strong></h2>



<p>If you have any furniture, you would like to keep, buy a cover for it, same with the car and all the tables. Covers save items. Make sure you have a few for rotation so it doesn&rsquo;t get dirty when you are washing one set.</p>



<p>cover can also be easy to wash, keep that in mind.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>5.&nbsp;Spend As Much Time With Them As Possible</strong></h2>



<p>As much as you probably hear it, the years&nbsp;pass&nbsp;quickly. And I am not talking about spending&nbsp;as much time with them on the weekend or as possible. </p>



<p>I mean, if you are working drop one day a week, or more, at the end of your life would you rather have more in your bank account or more memories and a great relationship with your children? </p>



<p>You can&rsquo;t buy them&nbsp;it later and you make more of a difference in the world by being a great parent than having a lot of stuff and money. (just a note, I&rsquo;m not saying stuff and money is bad, I certainly like it, you just need to determine priorities. </p>



<p>If you can fit both in, then I say go for it.)</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Child&rsquo;s Health</strong></h2>



<p>Your child&rsquo;s health is most likely one of your top priorities. Your child will most likely catch and show symptoms of many illnesses throughout their childhood. </p>



<p>But remember,&nbsp;billions of children have all been there before. Every little snuffle doesn&rsquo;t need a panic attack. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s worse with your first child as everything is new. Make sure you have your health care professional number or health line number (if your country has one)&nbsp;handy and a quick ring can easily put your mind at ease. </p>



<p>I know you might sometimes want to wrap them in cotton wool, but little bodies are amazingly resilient and can handle almost anything&nbsp;thrown at them. </p>



<p>Viruses / Bacteria are a natural part of life and amazingly enough, catching for example the measles actually primes their immune system. Childhood illnesses help them live healthier lives and strengthens their immune system.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheap Is Better</strong></h2>



<p>As they all say, get a child an amazing toy and watch them play with the cardboard box. </p>



<p>I have found that the best toys are simple ones in which you play with them. </p>



<p>Paper airplanes, cardboard boxes, toilet roll, park,&nbsp;nature walk&nbsp;or a ball are extremely fun and provide many more laughs.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>8.&nbsp;Saying No Or Yelling Makes It Worse</strong></h2>



<p>I know there can be points where you get that frustrated, you just want to yell back at them. </p>



<p>Regrettably from personal experience, saying no, or yelling does nothing other than make it all worse. </p>



<p>Go an vent your frustration in another room and then come back and think of something to do, or a way to change the situation. </p>



<p>If you yell, prepare for more screaming and a worse situation.</p>



<p>Before saying no to a child, try to think of something else to do. Saying no keeps them still focused on what you are trying to get away from them. </p>



<p>If you suggest something else or a number of other things, you will eventually get them to play or do something else. It works very well, though may take just a little of perseverance.</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Children&rsquo;s Copy EVERYTHING!</strong></h2>



<p>Not only will they repeat words and things said at awkward moments&nbsp;<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100418022757im_/https://www.naturalparentingtips.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">, but they learn your personality traits, habits and how you handle everything. </p>



<p>You are teaching them how they will act as an adult. If you have bad habits either don&rsquo;t let your children see at the very least, but it is best to better yourself to help your child grow into the best they can be.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never Be Afraid To Better Your Parenting</strong></h2>



<p>If I never tried to better my parenting,&nbsp;I would still do some things that today I would feel guilty about doing. </p>



<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to accept you may have done something wrong by your child, I have personally had to accept this a few times, but ignoring it just so you don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty about it only means you harm your child longer. </p>



<p>I know I am still not perfect, but I am always open to new ideas and better ways to be a better parent, as I want the best for my children, regardless of how it makes me feel.</p>



<h2>conclussion</h2>



<p>If you are thinking about having a child but waiting for the right time. There is never a right time. Get it now, time is running.</p>

<p>One of my friends asked me, is jealousy in a relationship normal? Because he gets more and more jealous lately. He trusts his girlfriend but can&rsquo;t help it. He gets jealous over minor things, even the ones that mean nothing.</p>



<p>Jealous in the common relationship problems. Human beings get jealous so easily. But you need to learn how to control it. Because it can ruin your relationship. </p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t take it seriously, it can cause marital relationship problems. This will make it hard to communicating in a relationship.</p>



<p>Start now and help yourself stop jealousy and possessiveness. This will help improve your relationship. </p>



<p>The following video will help you stop jealousy for ever!</p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zExmfQqQekw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<h2>What usually triggers jealousy?</h2>



<p>Several things can trigger your love partner&rsquo;s jealousy. If you feel anything can harm your relationship, it can make you jealous. Let me make an example. If your partner is about to go with friends, the fear of what will happen. </p>



<p>Since you won&rsquo;t be present, it will make you jealous he might have so much fun that he won&rsquo;t even miss you, can also trigger jealousy. Some experiences can make them jealous. </p>



<p>Low self-esteem can drive jealousy. Especially with women they from time to time feel less attractive and confident. It can be caused by looking up in other people&rsquo;s relationships too much. Not spending enough time with your partner can be an issue.</p>



<h3>Feeling insecure</h3>



<p>Many people for emotional insecurity in their relationship. For overcoming insecurity you understand it goes hand in hand with jealousy.</p>



<p>You may feel your partner is thinking about breaking up with you all the time. If you feel this way it time you get self-help for insecurity.</p>



<p>Dealing with jealousy and insecurity in a relationship is something you can do yourself. But you can also talk to your partner. So he can help you with fighting insecurity.</p>



<p>What you might find out is your partner is facing the same problem since this is the common problem.</p>



<h2>Unhealthy jealous behaviour.</h2>



<ul><li>Assuming your partner is not attracted to you.</li><li>Accusing your partner of cheating with no proof.</li><li>Checking your partner&rsquo;s phone without permission.</li><li>The tendency to compare yourself to others.</li><li>Fear of not being good enough.</li><li>Asking your partner to ditch his/her friends.</li><li>Show up uninvited.</li><li>Choose who your partner can talk to and can not talk to.</li><li>you are always suspicious.</li><li>Demand attention.</li></ul>



<p>These are the red flags! If you see these in your relationship. It time you sit down with your partner, try to find the solutions. Learn how to behave in a relationship! Know when you are being jealous. This will help you avoid several things. Including a quick temper, which is an enormous problem on its own. One minute you want to chat, the next you angry they take too long to respond. Jealousy can be abusive.</p>



<h2>How to stop jealousy actions?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-to-stop-jealousy-actions-1024x576.jpg" alt="How to stop jealousy actions" class="wp-image-776"></figure>



<ul><li>Trust your partner he/she is old enough to know what right and wrong. Sometimes you may not believe them, act as if you believe. Get enough proof then you can act on it. If your partner says I love you, believe them.</li><li>Understand every relationship is different. Comparing your relationship with others won&rsquo;t bring anything good. You can both learn one or two things from others, but don&rsquo;t force that into your own relationship. You have your own qualities, they have theirs.</li><li>Understand you can lose your partner. The less you worry about losing your partner, the easier it would be to fight jealousy. Enjoy each moment, but be prepared for anything. It okay to fear losing someone, but try to use that fear for improving your relationship. Do everything you could.</li><li>Respect your partner and make sure they respect you. If someone loves and respects you. They will know what they can and can&rsquo;t do in front of you, even when you not around. If they respect you, you won&rsquo;t be jealousy.</li><li>Be honest about how your partner&rsquo;s actions make you feel. Talk about those feelings. Listen to what your partner has to say.</li><li>Understanding jealousy is not a call to action. Jealousy is a feeling because you feel that way doesn&rsquo;t mean you are right.</li></ul>



<p>How to control jealousy will depend on what causes you to be jealous. Secondly, the type of jealousy that you have.  You may have obsessive jealousy. This can make you think your partner is unfaithful, accompanied by compulsive checking of partners&rsquo; behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or you may be jealousy that your partner is doing well.</p>



<p>There are many types of jealousy each you must overcome differently.</p>



<p>Insecurity causes most of the time jealous. That the best place to start is fighting your insecurities. </p>

<h2>Anger and jealousy</h2>



<p>Anger and jealousy go hand in hand. Jealousy produces&nbsp;emotions such as&nbsp;anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness or disgust.</p>



<p>This creates an unhealthy relationship for you and your partner. Some addicted in spending time with their partner.</p>



<p>If the partner is going to spend time with someone else they feel these tremendous bursts of anger build up inside them.</p>



<p>Which puts your partner in danger of your anger. You need to understand where is your anger coming from. </p>



<p>Controlling your emotions is easy. But you must know where are those emotions coming from. If jealousy makes you angry. Find out where is that anger coming from.</p>



<p>sometimes it can be because out what your partner did in the past, or things that happened in your childhood. </p>



<p>For example, if growing up in your mother was having more than one partner and she was doing that in front of you. </p>



<p>You will have a hard time trusting women. Therefore, it is important to know where is my anger coming from. So you can take necessary actions to deal with your jealousy and anger.</p>
