<p>I and my wife were talking about the other last night. It seems like people like to make a big deal out of the small stuff.</p>



<p>She used to be like this, and there was a time where I was like this. But as you grow older, you realize this not how you live with others. We all make mistakes, there is no need to fight about everything.</p>



<p>Because having a tendency to make a big deal out of minor matters can ruin a relationship. I always tell people not to start a fight unless it beyond your powers.</p>



<p>If you make big deal out of everything. That when your partner might say you talk too much. This can be the beginning of an unhealthy relationship.</p>



<p>So, today I&rsquo;m saying, <strong>Stop Making A Big Deal Over the Little Things.</strong></p>



<iframe width="760" height="415" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-RhYewEbOz4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Find good habits for your relationship. This is the nasty habit and you must find a way to of breaking this habit. It does more harm than good.</p>



<p>There are many good patterns you can teach yourself. Same as bad ones, if you want a healthy relationship. You must stop the bad patterns.</p>



<p>If you make a big deal out of every minor situation. This means you controlling, and no one enjoys being with a controlling partner.</p>



<p>Once you stop making a big deal out of everything. This is when you will learn the skill to solve problems, without fighting with your partner.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to know your partner is old enough to know right for wrong.&nbsp; No need to remind him no, this is wrong every time.</p>



<p>He already knows what he did was wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Always ask yourself is this worth my time. It is easy to shout at people until we lose them.</p>



<p>I understand it can happen, that your partner thinks it not a big deal. But it is for you. That also happens all the time.</p>



<p>In a case, where your partner thinks it not a big deal and you think otherwise. Talk to them like the adult. They would understand no need to fight every time.</p>



<p>If you have talked to your partner several times and he keeps doing the same. Then we can make it a big deal.!</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Preventing fighting from ruining your relationship</h2>



<p>The first thing which is wrong. We think relationship and marriages are hard.</p>



<p>So, when our relationship has problems. We take this as normal and don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. So, we can deal with it.</p>



<p>We get advice. Relationships are hard work. If you want to stay in a relationship, fight to keep it.</p>



<p>But you don&rsquo;t fight for a relationship, which is health. If you must always fight for your relationship, that not health. Some day you might realize no, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>



<p>The problem started when you believed fight is normal in a relationship. A single fight can be normal. But if it happens often, that not normal.</p>



<p>You will have arguments, issues, and hard times. But should not escalate to fights. Because in a good relationship there is clear communication and problem-solving strategy.</p>



<p>Consistent fighting and making a big deal out of small things. That not normal and it could be your strategy of dealing with fight is not working. It can also mean one of you is falling out of love.</p>



<ul><li>Falling out of love can make you fight for things that don&rsquo;t matter.</li><li>It can also mean you are angry about something. That you haven&rsquo;t addressed yet. For example, they do not please you in bed. So everything upsets you.</li><li>You could fight about something that happened in the past. You have talked about it and it passed. But months later you re-think it and be angry. This time you show your anger in other things. Even though it is still connected to what happened in the past.</li></ul>



<p>This can make your relationship unhealthy, and you might not even realize it. If this continues it creates a bigger problem. Can even end the relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Break the circle of fighting</h3>



<p><strong>Deal with what in front of you right now.</strong></p>



<p>What I mean is, don&rsquo;t talk about what happened yesterday or the other month. Instead, fix only what you are talking about now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Leave-the-past-in-the-past-1024x576.jpg" alt="Leave the past in the past. Where it belong!" class="wp-image-795"></figure>



<p>If you had a problem and talked about it. Then your partner apologized. If he apologized and you saw, he meant what he said. Never bring that up again. Even when you are fighting about something else.</p>



<p>If it is something that happened last week. It must be completely off the table. You fix everything as it happens and moving on with your relationship. Without allowing problems to add up on top on one another.</p>



<p>Keeping a record of everything is wrong. First, you did this second, you did that, now you are doing this. That all wrong! </p>



<p>Because you have talked about it and came up with a solution. Why are you even mad about it for a week or a month later?</p>



<p>When you keep bringing up things. Which happened in the past, over and over. You are not allowing your relationship to move forward.</p>



<p>When you focus at the moment. Your communication skills will improve.</p>



<p>If you keep everything that happened in the past. You will win the fight. But your partner knows what you did in the past, too. So, if he is also bringing everything too, he will win. This means the conversation is not going forward and the relationship.</p>



<p>If you forgive someone it means you put that in the past. If it too much to forgive don&rsquo;t continue with that relationship.</p>



<h3 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Words you need to avoid when arguing in the relationship.</h3>



<p>Let me assume the reason for you to read this article is that you are in a similar situation. Where you and your partner are always fighting and one is making a big deal out of everything.</p>



<p>I want to warn you about two words you should avoid when fighting. These words are 1 <strong>always </strong>2<strong> never!</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Always-and-never-1024x576.jpg" alt="always and never" class="wp-image-798"></figure>



<p>It is something you never thought about before. But it is very damaging.</p>



<p>It can take some time to break the habit. Knowing this is something I should stop will make you one step ahead.</p>



<p><strong>Let me make an example of what I mean.</strong></p>



<ul><li>You are always starting a fight</li><li>You always messing things up</li><li>We always do what you want us to do</li><li>You always make fun of me</li><li>I always must do everything</li><li>You always ignore me</li><li>You never listen to me</li><li>You never cared</li><li>You never help</li><li>You are never romantic</li><li>You never put effort into anything</li><li>You never let me choose</li></ul>



<p>Think about it. The chances of never and always being accurate are small to none. We use always and never when we frustrated or angry about something.</p>



<p>What these words do. They also make your partner frustrated too. Because even though your partner was wrong. Your partner won&rsquo;t agree with what you are saying. This can start a separate fight on top of the one. You are already fighting about.</p>



<p>Two, it puts extra blame on your partner. For example, if you say your partner always mess thing up. This means since the day you meant them. They always mess thing up and that such a wrong thing to say.It not fair to say because it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>



<p>Get to the root of the problem. Solve that problem without involving everything that happened before<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>If you don&rsquo;t get to the root of the problem. You leave that problem unsolved. Because instead of solving it. You brought back the old one. Even those were not solved. Because you also brought the older ones.</p>



<p>This becomes a chain of unsolved problems, and they will keep coming up. Causing you to fight all the time!</p>



<p>This can make you make a big deal out of small things. Because a lot of problems are stuck in your head unsolved.<br>Let us say your partner is talking about something you do that they don&rsquo;t like. But they are not fighting with you yet. Telling you what they don&rsquo;t like.</p>



<p>If you respond by saying, you always picking a fight. This means you don&rsquo;t care about their feelings and you are reversing the problem to them.</p>



<p>The next thing that is going to happen. The fight will worsen. The other partner may even become more frustrated. Because you show you don&rsquo;t even care.</p>



<p>So, this way of handling things solves no problem. It makes things worse!</p>



<h4 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">If your partner use always or never in you. What then?</h4>



<p>There will be a time where your partner says you always do this, or you never do this. You as a person who already knows. How damaging those words can be. You must have a different manner.</p>



<p>If your partner says. You always pick a fight. You must keep calm and say come sit down here, let talk about it. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way. That I always pick a fight. I know we need to be better in handling our problems. Show your partner you care about their feelings. </p>



<p>Ask them what is it moving forward that they want you to do. To solve this problem.</p>



<p>You are solving a problem. Instead of reversing the problem to the other partner or bringing up the past.</p>



<p>Understand what exactly is bordering your partner right now. What role can I play moving forward to make things better for us? How can we make this better together?</p>



<p>If you talk to your partner like this. They feel</p>



<ul><li>You are hearing</li><li>You respect their feelings</li><li>You care</li><li>You are working together as a team.</li></ul>



<p>By doing this, it can cool the other partner way faster. Showing you care, makes the other person feel loved and acknowledged. This is why you are together.</p>



<p>Your partner doesn&rsquo;t want to be angry. They are not speaking to you to annoy you. They are trying to solve the problem. So don&rsquo;t make the problem worse.</p>



<p>If you tell your partner &ldquo;you never listen to me&rdquo;. This means they have never listened to you, ever since you started dating. How true is that?</p>



<p>It like you are telling your partner, they are always wrong and the only reason you are still together is you. Which is not fair!</p>



<p>Each person has a unique mind and voice. Using always and never will make your relationship to grow apart. This will cause a lot of unnecessary fights. Without you understanding where they have come from.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">Tips for fighting fair</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIGHTING-FAIR-1024x576.jpg" alt="FIGHTING FAIR" class="wp-image-807"></figure>



<p>This article is about a relationship. Where partners fight all the time. The relationship where everything turns in to a big deal. The aim is to help you reduce fight in your relationship. &nbsp;Because fight can turn even a perfect relationship into a sour one.</p>



<p>So, we need to look at this problem in many viewpoints and give you unique solutions.</p>



<p>There are many ways partners deal with the conflict. Both partners must not try to win the conversation. Without interest in solving the problem.</p>



<p>Both partners want the fight to end. But it cannot if the fight is going in the wrong direction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is a problem in your relationship. But both of you are defensive. It is less likely you will move forward. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do you fight fair?</strong></p>



<ol type="1"><li>There is a saying don&rsquo;t go to bed angry. It&rsquo;s time we rethink that. We must teach our self to take a break if something is frustrating us. Even if that means going to bed angry, it is fine we will talk about it tomorrow. But this will help us avoid saying things we don&rsquo;t mean because we are angry. It also gives us time to think. The next day you might even realize. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this anymore, it is not worth the time. This will help us stop saying things in a mean way, harsh and hurtful.
