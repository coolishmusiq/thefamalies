<p>Talk about family problems you can expect in any marriage. Every family has problems and we can never run away from it. If you believe your family won&rsquo;t have problems. You are just setting yourself for a disaster. Because you won&rsquo;t know how to act. When you reach that point in life.</p>



<p>If your family doesn&rsquo;t have problems it because you are the problem and they haven&rsquo;t told you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/marriage-is-not-easy-1024x576.jpg" alt="marriage is not easy" class="wp-image-856"></figure>



<ul><li>Either you are going to be a problem</li><li>You are going to marry a problem</li><li>Either you are going to marry a family with problems</li><li>Or you will have problems entering your marriage from the outside</li><li>Either your family is the problem&nbsp;</li><li>Or the combination of them all</li></ul>



<p>&ldquo;Marriage will show you how selfish you are, and parenting will show you how angry you are.&rdquo; That true and common in marriages.</p>



<p>Children are growing and still have lots of mistakes to make. Parents want them to act right all the time.</p>



<p>The wife is raised by a different family and the husband. There are days where they won&rsquo;t see eye to eye. Some days one will be selfish and the other will have pride.</p>



<p>If pride enters a marriage. Your spouse won&rsquo;t care if his/her beliefs are wrong or right. They know what they want and will try to convince you to do things their way.</p>



<p>Some days you will wish they can do things in a certain way. But no one will care about you.</p>



<p>We need to be aware all these struggles will happen. How you all deal with those problems. Will determine if your marriage will work or fail. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no such thing as a perfect marriage. Only families with better problem-solving skills.</p>



<p>If they do things your way all the time. You are selfish, maybe your partner won&rsquo;t tell you. But that selfishness and not the right way to treat your family.</p>



<p>Both partners must have a voice and play a part in how we arrive in conclusions. You must include your partner in your decisions. You must talk it through and come out with what seems to be a win for both of you.</p>



<h2>Why it so hard to forgive your spouse</h2>



<p>If your spouse upsets or lets you down. It is difficult to forgive. If you forgive someone, it means you understand what they did to you. But you will no longer hold it against them.</p>



<p>This process is not as easy as it sounds. Your spouse must help you in forgiving him or her. If they are not sorry for what they did or defensive about it. Forgiving become very hard.</p>



<p>It gets easy to forgive your spouse. If they sit down with you and talk about the problem. Telling you they understand what they did was wrong. They are sorry and it won&rsquo;t happen again. They completely understand there is nothing they can do to make this right. Except for saying sorry and they feel bad while take a responsibility for it. <strong>Last, they feel bad that it hurt you.</strong></p>



<p>That helping your spouse forgive you and it make it easy. Once your spouse understands that you know what you did was wrong. They can forgive you and let go.</p>



<p>What will make this hard is when your spouse says &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do something wrong, what your problem? Just get over it&rdquo;. This makes you even more upset because they did something wrong and they are not sorry about it.</p>



<p>Your spouse is not taking responsibility and they make you sound crazy for even talking about it. This makes it hard for a marriage to be healthy and moving forward.</p>



<p>This becomes a problem if your spouse hurts you over and over. Without being sorry because it keeps adding up. Even if they always come around and ask for forgiveness. It raises a question if you love me the way you say you do. Why do you hurt me in the 1st place? It&rsquo;s hard to forgive someone who constantly hurt you.</p>



<p>So, until there is a change in their behavior it never easy.</p>



<h2>Cheating in marriages</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/affairs-in-yourr-marriage-1024x576.jpg" alt="affairs in your marriage" class="wp-image-855"></figure>



<p>Cheating is the worst issue in marriage and it is hard to recover from it.&nbsp; We see it happening more and more these days. If someone cheats, they can&rsquo;t blame anything or anyone. Rather than blaming themselves.</p>



<p>What disturbing there is no way to make a relationship be 100% affair-proof. You can do everything right but that doesn&rsquo;t make you safe. You can even be a church person in your marriage. It still doesn&rsquo;t guarantee your partner won&rsquo;t go out.</p>



<p>The only thing that will stop your spouse from cheating on you is themselves not you.&nbsp; If they constantly remind themselves, they have someone who loves them back home. Making it their responsibility to control themselves from temptations.</p>



<p>You can only 100% guide you, with your partner you can&rsquo;t be 100%.&nbsp; But you need to trust them when temptations come. They will do the right thing.</p>



<p>There are things you can do to control yourself. Like telling yourself I can&rsquo;t be alone with another man. Because I&rsquo;m married. I can&rsquo;t have things like male friends. All that increase the risk and your chances of doing the wrong things.</p>



<p>We live in a digital age and we see more and more cheating starting from texting. Then keep growing until it something physical. Naked marriage is important than ever. If you are married there is no need for privacy. I must know everything about your passwords and accounts.</p>



<p>Cheating is a process. People start by talking, then dates before they will even sleep with each other.</p>



<p>Knowing everything about your partner still doesn&rsquo;t guarantee your spouse won&rsquo;t cheat. Though it decreases the chances of this happening.</p>



<p>I had a friend who was married and had two phones. One stayed in the car and he was only using it for cheating. Even with transparency we still can&rsquo;t be sure cheating won&rsquo;t happen in marriages.</p>



<h2>Parenting-styles differences</h2>



<p>Married couples turn to have different views when it comes to parenting. An example of this is when they discover their son is gay. It usually easy for a wife to accept the son as he is, but for a husband, it takes some time.</p>



<ul><li>Some parents let kids regulate themselves and be more like a friend to them. Instead of being a parent.</li><li>Some parents demand obedience from their kids. If kids don&rsquo;t obey, there will be a tough consequences.</li><li>Some parents have high expectation, yet loving at the same time. Not too hard on kids not too soft.</li><li>Some parents just don&rsquo;t care about their kids at all</li></ul>



<p>With this different style of parenting, it causes a problem in marriages. Especially in marriages where step kids are involved. Most wives like to raise kids in a friendly way. However, dads are usually hushing ones. This can sometimes lead to conflicts in marriages.</p>



<h2>Connecting with your busy spouse</h2>



<p>If you marry someone, you must agree. For better or worse you will stand by them.&nbsp; Even when you get busy and life gets busy. You will stand by them.</p>



<p>Connecting to your partner is so important in a healthy marriage. Me personally I really can&rsquo;t stand hours without talking to my wife. Even when I am busy, I make time. I want to know how she is doing and how her day is treating her.</p>



<p>Busyness leads to neglect. Once you neglect your partner, they get lonely. If loneliness enters your marriage. Then it&rsquo;s time to eliminate things that are not your priority. Like friends and everything that might not be your priority. Use that time to connect with your spouse. Marriage must be the number one priority of all time.</p>



<p>The wife can do so much at home to a point where the husband feels neglected. If you clean, cook, and put so much effort into helping kids. Sometimes that can make us as husband feel left out.</p>



<p>If you feel this way, then talk about it find a solution and balance.&nbsp; Because as small as this sounds, it can make a husband cheat on you. If he is feeling left out. Once he cheats the small problem is now a big one. You really need to connect with your busy spouse in your marriage.</p>



<p>It is not nice to miss your spouse while you stay with them. Couples slowly drift apart and later realize there are no longer in love. They are just a roommate.</p>



<h2>Feeling like a prisoner in your marriage</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/prisoner-in-your-marriage-1024x576.jpg" alt="prisoner in your marriage" class="wp-image-857"></figure>



<p>Marriages are not child&rsquo;s games. Many people get into marriage unprepared. If you enter marriage not knowing your partner enough, or if you enter marriage not knowing what is a marriage, or chose a wrong spouse. Then we can safely say you entered a marriage <strong>unprepared.</strong></p>



<p>Happens a lot and they realize later. This is not something they wanted. But it difficult to end a marriage, there is so much to lose.</p>



<p>Your wife moved out of her home and they are not expecting her to come back. You as a man you stand a chance of losing half of every you own. Their kids don&rsquo;t want you to break up. Because they will have to pick sides. You lose respect and time. That a lot and that why most people end up feeling trapped or feeling like prisoners in their own marriage.</p>



<p>If it was a relationship, my advice would be to end a relationship. But since it a marriage, I can&rsquo;t advise you to do that. Instead, I can advise you to take responsibility and say this is my marriage. I&rsquo;m going to fight for it. Start writing everything that making your marriage to move backward. Try to fix those issues.</p>



<p>Find people with similar problems. Whether it podcasts or online communities, or social media it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Find them and understand. How did they overcome the same problems that you are facing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time when I&rsquo;m angry at my wife and I listen to the podcast. I usually find out even though I&rsquo;m angry. I&rsquo;m also wrong and it is great to find advice from people who don&rsquo;t know you.</p>



<p>Because they don&rsquo;t hide the truth from you. They tell you everything as it is.</p>



<h2>Financial abuse in marriages</h2>



<p>Financial abuse in marriage is real and something most people are not aware of. Yet it plays a huge role in marriage problems and divorce. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Let look at housewives as our example. Some homemakers stay home by choice. They have talked about it with her husband, and the husband has no problem with providing for a family. If a wife wakes up one day. Start saying honey, I want to work now and be independent. The husband says no! because she wants her to always depend on him. That is financial abuse!</p>



<p>Financial abuse comes in many forms in marriages. There are situations where your spouse knows nothing about your finances. Where they are and how do use them. Inside marriage, this is abuse. Marriage will never be healthy. Until there is trust and transparency. If you hide your money from me. It makes me wonder, <strong>what else are you hiding from me?</strong></p>



<p>The other form of financial abuse we see all the time. When your spouse wants details of every cent you spend. If you went out and did shopping without them knowing. Even if it something useful which was really needed. They will still be mad at you.</p>



<p>Because you didn&rsquo;t talk to them first. This is financial abuse, and it&rsquo;s not like your partner was hiding it from you. If she tells you, &ldquo;while you were working, I thought we needed this, so I went out and bought it&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Financial abuse leads to domestic violence in most marriages. We live in a world where it cost money to do things. This is sad if you want to make your partner be 100% dependent on you.</p>



<p>When you don&rsquo;t even give them the freedom to do things they like. Just because you are the one providing.</p>



<p>Another practical example is when your partner is gambling vast amounts of money. You end up not knowing if there will be enough money left by the end of the month to pay bills. The days when your spouse lost in gambling, he will come home grumpy to everyone.</p>



<p>That financial abuse and it is sad to think some families go through all that.</p>

<h3>What is not a financial abuse in marriages</h3>



<p>If you set a budget together. Talk about how are you going to use both your finances. That not abuse but working together! When the money comes. You both know what are your priorities. How much you will be spending and how much you can use in your personal needs.</p>



<p>If your spouse wants to be involved in your financial decision that not abuse. If we are married it no longer your money but our money. So, it&rsquo;s nice if I get involved in decisions. Especially if the result is going to effects the family.</p>



<p>If your spouse asks you about the budget. That also not financial abuse you need a budget in your marriage.</p>



<p>But if you avoid all these questions about the budget. Yet your spouse wants to know. Then you are abusing your spouse.&nbsp;</p>
