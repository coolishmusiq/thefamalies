<p>Once you become an Ex, a lot of drama and confusion is involved. Should you block him? Should you continue supporting him? If I do what this means?</p>



<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to help you deal with your ex the right way. Also, answer the question like. How do you know when it over? Do you still love your ex or you are just lonely?</p>



<p>There are many reasons you think about your ex.&nbsp; You might miss those late-night talk and if you haven&rsquo;t found a new partner. You will miss your ex the most. Thinking about your ex doesn&rsquo;t mean you must get back together. Sometimes you must move on. Because <strong>going back might hurt you even more.</strong></p>



<p>Accepting the relationship is over can be hard and the longer it takes, the harder it gets. After getting a new partner, it gets better. The thoughts of your ex will never be permanently forgotten. However, you will feel better after a few years. It like the death of someone we love. It gets hard, at the 1<sup>st</sup> until we learn to leave without them.</p>



<p>If you think about your ex. Yet you don&rsquo;t think they deserve a second chance. It helps to spend more time with family and friends. Until you find someone.</p>



<p>Failing to find a new relationship will make you think about your ex even more. Don&rsquo;t be stuck in your past, because it would be all you see. You can still find someone new. That will value and respect you.</p>



<p>There is a reason your last relationship ended. Don&rsquo;t forget about those reasons. History always repeats itself, if we keep going back to your past.</p>



<p>If we are in a relationship, we follow certain patterns. Sometimes we miss things we did with our exes, not necessarily them.&nbsp; If you are lucky to find someone new, who will teach you new patterns. That when we forget the old ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missing your ex means you are lonely, and you haven&rsquo;t found a new life. Which will close the gap for your old life.</p>



<p>It is hard to understand. If you miss your ex or just having someone to spend quality time with. Or you just miss sex.</p>



<p>However, it also possible you are still in love with your ex. If you made a quick decision without thinking it through. Sometimes we end relationships just to avoid solving problems.</p>



<p>If that the case, your mind knows you ended the relationship without good reasoning. Your relationship can still work, you just need to put pride aside and solve your problems.</p>



<p>But there must never be a day when you try so hard to get your ex back. Doing this will give your ex more power and they might take you for granted. Even when you are truly in love with your ex. Wait until they prove they still have the attention in a relationship.</p>



<h2>What do you do if you still like your ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/still-like-your-ex.jpg" alt="still like your ex" class="wp-image-881"></figure>



<p>Some relationships can end while you are still in love. If this happens, it can be hard to move on. Not because you cannot move on. You don&rsquo;t want to move on. Maybe you still wish your ex can come back and apologize.</p>



<p>This can make you feel stuck in your past relationship. The worse thing that can happen, your ex might never apologize. If you still love you ex, yet no chance of a rebound. You must first accept it over. If you don&rsquo;t accept it ended. You won&rsquo;t think about what to do next.</p>



<p>You will keep thinking about what if you did things differently. Maybe the outcome would be different. Which is true, but you didn&rsquo;t accept it. It takes two people to be in a relationship. If one is no longer be part of it, then it no longer a relationship.</p>



<p>The only time I can advise you to go after your ex, is when your ex haven&rsquo;t moved on too. They are not involved in a new relationship and they are still in contact you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But going after your ex when they have moved on. Can put you in a very painful position. You can also talk to your friends and family members. People who knew your relationship very well. Ask for advice on what to do. If they know the relationship is not good for you, they will tell you.</p>



<p>Loving yourself and opening up to a new life. Will help you move your focus away from your ex. Make your breakup the opportunity to do new things. You couldn&rsquo;t do it in a relationship.</p>



<p>When the breakup is still new. You will think about all the bad things about your ex. When time goes by you think about the wonderful memories. That when you will miss your ex the more. But just because you are thinking about the good times. Doesn&rsquo;t mean your partner is good for you.</p>



<p>Going back to your ex just because you have the old wonderful memories. Does not mean all those good things will happen again if you get back together.</p>



<h2>Why do exes contact you out of the blue?</h2>



<p>Should I call back my ex? Your ex can contact you for different reasons. The best way to understand is to talk to them. Even though you can ignore him/her. Maybe you want peace in your life.</p>



<p>Some exes are lonely and want to have a conversation. Sometimes when they go through a hard time. They want support from you. Especially if they haven&rsquo;t found a new partner to replace you.</p>



<p>It is totally up to you to answer or call back your ex. If you still have feeling and the reason for a breakup are not that bad. Why not! But if you feel they don&rsquo;t deserve your time, then don&rsquo;t give them attention.</p>



<h2>Does dreaming of an ex mean they miss you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dreaming-of-your.jpg" alt="dreaming of your ex" class="wp-image-876"></figure>



<p>Dreaming about your ex will make you question yourself. Do I still love my ex? If you have a new relationship. It will feel you are betraying your new partner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex can mean two things. You miss your ex or your ex misses you. Most cases if you thought about your ex before you went to sleep. There is a high chance you might dream of your ex that night.</p>



<p>If your ex thinks or talks about you. The universe can hear that and talk to you back with a dream.&nbsp; This is why we dream about most recent events more often.</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex giving you advice. Your mind is telling not to repeat same mistakes you did with your ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dreaming of your ex death doesn&rsquo;t mean your ex is dying. But your feelings for the old relationship are dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h2>Can exes fall back in love?</h2>



<p>Yes, your ex can fall back in love with you and it happens more than you might think.</p>



<p>If they lost no dignity in your breakup. It is still possible to get back together and still possible your ex misses you too.</p>



<p>This will also depend on the age of your relationship. If you and your ex have a lot of history together. It won&rsquo;t be easy to move on for any of you.</p>



<p>But <strong>your relationship ended for a reason don&rsquo;t forget</strong>. If your relationship with your ex was in an excellent position or healthy. It wouldn&rsquo;t have ended in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Before you make your ex fall back in love. You must think of every problem you were having in your relationship. Think if they can be solvable or not. If your relationship had serious problems like <strong>cheating and abuse</strong>. Forget about that relationship, <strong>just forget</strong>.</p>



<p>But if your ex was bringing value in your life. Yet, you didn&rsquo;t realize how much your ex was helping you. Now that your relationship is over. Your life is not complete anymore.</p>



<p>Think of everything you did which made you ex to fall out. Fix your self 1<sup>st</sup> before you go back to apologize. The only way to make your ex fall back. Will begin by you admitting all your mistakes and making sure you don&rsquo;t repeat them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exes often come back but don&rsquo;t wait for your ex. They might not come back.</p>



<h2>How do you know if an ex misses you?</h2>



<p>How do you know if your ex secretly misses you? Most of us will use a breakup as a time to heal. Once we heal, we may miss our old relationship.</p>



<p>But even when we miss our exes, sometimes pride can kick in. We wait for them to miss us too.</p>



<h3>If one of these things happens. Then your ex could be missing you.</h3>



<ul><li>If your ex blocked you on a breakup and recently unblocked you.</li><li>If your ex finds random excuses to contact you.</li><li>Start asking about you in your friends and family.</li><li>Call you or text you when they are drunk.</li><li>Start stalking you on social media.</li><li>Your ex is always happy to see you.</li><li>Remembers your birthdays.</li><li>Give your kids some money.</li></ul>



<p>These can be clues that your ex is missing you. But do you miss your ex? Your ex can miss you, yet if you have moved on. Don&rsquo;t go back.</p>



<h2>Do exes come back after months?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/exes-ccome-back-after-months.jpg" alt="exes ccome back after months" class="wp-image-878"></figure>



<p>Most of the time they will. Removing someone in your mind is difficult. Some forget after a few months, for some, it gets harder. &nbsp;Sometimes we have 0 control of our memories.</p>



<p>Most of the time your ex will come back after seeing you dating someone else. Seeing you with someone else can make your ex jealous.&nbsp; If you are in a new relationship. They feel like someone is winning something that belongs to them.</p>



<p>But if your ex date someone else quickly after a breakup. They might not come back. The only time they will come back is when. This new relationship they started is not what they hoped for.</p>



<p>If they also celebrated the breakup publicly. Even when they miss you, the chances of them coming back are too small.</p>



<p>Sometimes your ex will get back to you, just to prove a point. Or if you used to support your ex. They might miss you when they face tough times.</p>



<p>If your ex comes back after months. It can be a good thing or he/she is coming back with more problems.</p>



<h2>Should you keep supporting your ex?</h2>



<p>Stop supporting your ex after a breakup. Just stop! If you are no longer in a relationship. That person is no longer your responsibility.</p>



<p>Whether you support your ex emotional or financial. It is not your place to do that. Let your ex go, <strong>either they are with you or they are not.</strong></p>



<p>Stop trying to make yourself look important. You are just forcing yourself in a place you don&rsquo;t belong to.</p>



<p>Even if your ex is the one coming back for support. Keep in mind, they deserve nothing. They left you!</p>



<h2>Does silence make an ex miss you?</h2>



<p>Silence can make a man miss you. But not all men!</p>



<p>Silence can also make a man move on, from his past relationship.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, silence can work but there are no guarantees. <strong>A lot can happen while you are silent</strong>. You also have no right to blame him, since you went silent.</p>



<p>But it always a good idea to lay low sometimes. This helps you avoid saying things you don&rsquo;t mean. Just go silent make your ex wonder why you don&rsquo;t give them attention anymore. Have you found someone or you really don&rsquo;t have a feeling for them anymore?</p>



<p>Silence will make your exes realize your absence and start missing. But this can also trigger him to look for a new partner. Since your exes are now feeling lonely.</p>



<p>You can cut a guy off and let him miss you. Don&rsquo;t give him too much space though if you still love him. Because he will develop new patterns without you.</p>



<p>If you want to stop talking to your ex. So, your ex can miss you, know it does not end there. You still need to do more to make sure your plan works. Try this</p>



<ul><li>Keep in contact with your ex family members. Even though you don&rsquo;t talk to your ex.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t block your ex on social media. Make your ex see everything you are up too.</li><li>Invest in yourself, go out, and have fun.</li></ul>



<p>These can help if you want your ex to miss you. Yet you don&rsquo;t want to talk to him yet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Can you stay a friend with an ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/staying-friends-with-an-ex.jpg" alt="staying friends with an ex" class="wp-image-880"></figure>



<p>People ask this question a lot. The reason they want to stay friends with their ex. They still care about them and enjoy their company.</p>



<p>If you also feel this way, I have a question for you. <strong>If you still enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, why did you break up?</strong></p>



<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you both fix your problem instead of breaking up?</p>



<p>Because if you breakup with someone. It means you want nothing to do with them. But this is not a simple question to answer. I think it can really depend on you and what you want.</p>



<p>Someone who cheated on you, can not expect you to be friends with them after a breakup. However, if the breakup was just a small miss understanding. It&rsquo;s understandable to remain friends. It still depends on how big are your problems and can they be fixed.</p>



<p>But if you or your ex have new partners. Staying friends is a no go!</p>



<p>Since the relationship end for a reason. Staying a friend with your ex can also take away your time to heal. It is also a disrespect to your new relationship.</p>



<h2>Why do guys act like they don&rsquo;t care after a breakup?</h2>



<p><strong>Sometimes they are not acting, they really don&rsquo;t care</strong>. If you care about someone you do everything to keep them. If you still act like you don&rsquo;t care about a breakup. Then you didn&rsquo;t deserve that relationship in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Stop following your ex if you see they don&rsquo;t care after a breakup. Move back and force on you.</p>



<p>Once someone becomes your ex, they need not explain themselves to you. Because you are no longer together. <strong>That why they say what yours will always come to you.</strong></p>



<p>If your ex doesn&rsquo;t come back after a breakup. The relationship was never yours. Move on, you will find someone new. There is no person who is better than everyone. You can always find someone who is better than your ex. Don&rsquo;t be stuck with people who treat you like you mean nothing to them.</p>



<h2>Reason to take a break after a breakup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/healing-after-a-breakup.jpg" alt="healing after a breakup" class="wp-image-879"></figure>



<p>There are many reasons you should heal. After a failed relationship. Many of us jump into the next relationship. With hope, it will heal the past relationship. However, in most cases, it doesn&rsquo;t. taking a break can be good for your mental health.</p>



<p>Jumping to the next relationship can replace pain with happiness. But it won&rsquo;t heal you, once your new relationship slows down. You will feel more pain. You might even regret your decision. Going back is no longer a wise choice.</p>



<p>If your new relationship fails. You are now facing pain for two relationship. Which both didn&rsquo;t work.</p>



<p>Not allowing yourself to heal can create a lot of problems. <strong>Like trust issues, anger, insecurities, etc</strong>.</p>



<p>Moving on without healing can negatively affect your emotions and the way you think.</p>



<p>Breakups can be a trauma no matter what side you are on.</p>



<h3>Recovering after a breakup</h3>



<p>Some break up can be bad. But you need to pick yourself up and move on. Your life doesn&rsquo;t end in a breakup, there is still a lot you can accomplish.</p>



<p>Recovering also mean you finding the right partner the next time. Not repeating the same patterns of bad partners.</p>



<ul><li>In the first step, focus on helping yourself. Getting professional help if you feel your need one, talking to your family members. Talking to your friends asking them what to do in your situation. Reaching out to people who recently recovered from relationship fail, and more. You know who are your good friends and best family members are. Because not everyone knows you and understands you.</li><li>Teach yourself that it is okay to feel pain after a breakup. The pain is not permanent, and it is not the end of your world. You are in control and you have the power to take yourself out of that pain.</li><li>Take some time and point out what did you do wrong. So, you can start learning from your mistakes and avoid them as early as possible in your next relationship. Learn what made you pick this person and what was good about him. What was bad about him or what was bad about you both in your past relationship? Makes sure you get all the fact right before you start a new relationship. I cannot guarantee your next relationship will work out. But you will avoid most problems from your previous relationship.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t contact each other unless there are kids involved. But if you don&rsquo;t have kids with your ex. There is no need to follow your ex on social media or keeping in touch. Because you will be starting noticing things your ex is doing right. Which can make you fall in love and forget why you guy broke up in the first place.&nbsp;</li><li>The experiment has fun and put yourself out there. Try new things, try a new life. Make yourself available not only to a new partner. But new friends also. Everything new can be exciting, which can help you heal faster. The more you try new things, the faster you will move away from your past.</li><li>Regain confidence and trust in yourself. Just believe you can gain anything that you want. You need not settle for less and keep going back to people who hurt you. Trust yourself you can move on and get everything that you want. It is a process but when you know what you want. Eventual it will come to you.</li><li>Maintain your dignity after a breakup. Don&rsquo;t be a person who keeps begging for a relationship. No need to always try to fix your relationship. Especially if you see your partner don&rsquo;t care anymore. If someone makes up their decision that they no longer want to be in a relationship with you. Stop fighting it and accept their decision. Begging to make you look desperate, which makes your partner lose attraction even more. You are going to be okay regardless of what is happening in your life.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>How do you tell she&rsquo;s not over her ex?</h2>



<p>Dating someone who is not over his ex is painful. But how can you tell if your new girlfriend is not over her ex?</p>



<h3>These can be signs she is not over her ex.</h3>



<ul><li>She keeps making excuses to visit you.</li><li>She talks about her past relationship a lot.</li><li>She still keeps in contact with her ex.</li><li>She gets angry at you for no reason.</li><li>Never enjoy sex with you.</li><li>Always treating you, she will leave the relationship.</li><li>She doesn&rsquo;t want to meet your family.</li></ul>



<h2>Should you take back an ex who dumped you?</h2>



<p>If you still love them you can, but if you have moved on don&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>Because this means whatever they thought they were doing didn&rsquo;t work. Now they are coming back to you as a backup plane.</p>



<p>You need someone who will be full committed to you.</p>



<p>Not someone who will come and go when it suits him/her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Who hurts more after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Women are more sensitive than man. They also sacrifice a lot in a relationship then most men. They even sacrifice their family just to be with you.</p>



<p>Very few men can move out of their home just to be with a woman.</p>



<p>If a woman enters a relationship. They enter with everything they have.</p>



<p>If the relationship doesn&rsquo;t work, it is safe to say. Women will hurt the most.</p>



<h2>Who moves on faster after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Man can move on before a breakup. By the time the relationship gets in to a break up they are long gone. Sometimes by the time they end the relationship. They are already involved a new one.</p>



<p>While women on the other hand. Needs some time to heal after a break. It can take them a very long time to heal.&nbsp; Sometimes it even takes years for a woman to move on.</p>



<p>The only time man will have a hard time moving on after a breakup. Will only be a time where he fails to find a better partner. Which will replace the old one.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, even though men move on faster. This does not mean they don&rsquo;t miss you, or they are not hurting over the past relationship. They do but they don&rsquo;t allow the pain to control them.</p>



<h2>Why people get stuck after breakup?</h2>



<p>People sometime get stuck with they ex. Even though they know the relationship was not good for them.</p>



<h3>These can be the reasons they are stuck.</h3>



<ul><li>They get in denial, they know relationship was not good for them. Yet they keep think it can be fixed. But they failed to fix it.</li><li>Thinking their happiness belong to their ex-partner. That without their ex, they can&rsquo;t have a good time.</li><li>Hold on to the old promises.</li><li>Focusing too much on the great time they both shared. Not willing to try new things.</li><li>Busy asking themselves why me, instead of asking. What did I learn from this?</li><li>Comparing their life to someone else&rsquo;s life.</li><li>Staying in contact with their ex.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Most of my advice are based on my past experience. However, how you treat your ex is total up to you.</p>



<p>But if your keep making the wrong decisions there will be consequence. Those results can make you hurt repeatedly.</p>



<p>If you find yourself hurting by a same person repeatedly. This means you must look back into your decisions. Try to understand what role are you playing. How can you get yourself out?</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t allow more pain in your life. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, try new things that works. Stop trying things that can&rsquo;t be fixed and love yourself. Because you deserve all the good things like everyone else.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
