<p>Most dating apps have the worst reviews, and it is not surprising. I have tried dating online myself and it was a waste of my time. Dating apps back in 5-10 years used to be great. They were not this popular. Thus, you might hear stories like I meet my wife or husband on a dating app. This can sound tempting. The online dating game has changed a lot over the years. It is risky and a waste of time. Let look at the major reasons most people are losing interest in online dating.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="http://localhost/thefamilies/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Why-people-are-losing-interest-in-dating-apps-1024x576.jpg" alt="Why people are losing interest in dating apps" class="wp-image-1066" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Why-people-are-losing-interest-in-dating-apps-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Why-people-are-losing-interest-in-dating-apps-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Why-people-are-losing-interest-in-dating-apps-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Why-people-are-losing-interest-in-dating-apps.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Premium and gold members are a scam in dating apps</h2>



<p>Most online dating platforms will force you to get premium or gold membership. But the wrong thing about this. Even with a paid version, they still limit you. When you are sending too many inboxes with your premium or gold subscriptions. They will tell you have reached your daily limit. Which means you must pay more or wait 24 hours to send more.</p>



<p>If you don’t have premium and gold subscriptions, it is worse.</p>



<ul><li>They will hide who liked your profile</li><li>You won’t see who views your profile</li><li>Limit the number of profiles you can like</li><li>The number of inboxes you can send is not enough</li><li>Some won’t allow you to talk with gold or premium members. If you use a free version.</li></ul>



<h2>Scammers in online dating are real</h2>



<p>Scam in dating apps has raised a lot of questions. You get young players and the enormous ones. Common scams can include the following :</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Catfishing</strong>! This is when someone is pretending to be someone. Yet, using pictures they found on social media or<a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> Google</a>. Therefore, you fell in love thinking you have found your match. Yet, you to find you are being played.</li><li><strong>Picture editing</strong>! We use a lot of editing software these days. Sometimes you meet someone online and they look super-hot. But when you meet them in person, you get disappointed.</li><li><strong>Money scams</strong>! Some will scam you small amounts. Like when someone says they will visit you. But they don’t have money for a bus fare. When you send a bus fare. They will block you right away. Others target rich people and they will stick around for a very long time. Maybe 6 to 12 months. Then make up stories and borrow serious cash. You fall for a trap and they disappear.</li><li><strong>Human trafficking</strong>! These are the most dangerous people in the online dating community. They also use fake accounts, fake pictures, and fake locations. You can’t tell someone is trafficking human. Until you meet them. Then no one will ever see you again. Which is sad. Yet it happens all the time.</li><li><strong>Junk ads</strong>! Most dating apps have shady ads and some have viruses. This can harm your phone or computer. If not, add you on subscriptions. That will steal your airtime every day. You might end up changing your sim card.</li><li><strong>Data breaches</strong>! They have accused some platforms of selling information from their clients. Some are not secured enough. Hackers can steal your personal information. Like numbers and emails to use them for personal reasons.</li></ol>

<h2><strong>Dating apps can destroy your reputation</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>People who use these apps say it is embarrassing. It is hard to tell people you got someone online. If you see someone you know on a dating app. you can’t help it but wonder why are they using the dating apps. They also think the same of you. These apps are not for shy people like me.</p>



<p>Some use fake names and fake pictures. Not to scam people, but to hide from family and friend. After you have exchanged numbers. They reveal themselves to you. That if they like you.</p>



<p>You find people are in relationships or even married. But using these apps. which destroy their status, and the reputation of their spouse or whoever they are dating.</p>



<h2>Users are addicted to dating platforms.</h2>



<p>People go online to look for a partner and find one. But they never leave the dating apps. even when they found someone. They keep wanting more. Thinking they can get someone even better.</p>



<p>The most online relationship fails. They know they can always get more and more. The moment you break a promise or cannot show up. They are not interested in you anymore. Fixing problem is not the way they do things.</p>



<h3>They want hookups not genuine relationship</h3>



<p>If you are looking for a long-term relationship. Don’t waste your time with any dating app, try something else. Because they are looking for sex, not a proper relationship. If you think you will find someone who is loyal and committed. Don’t be surprised if it ends in tears.</p>



<p>You might get STD from a relationship which didn’t work.</p>



<p>The funny thing about this. You can meet someone online today and they only know 1 or 2 pictures of you. But within a few minutes, they want you to visit them. They don’t know your background. No clue about what you like and don’t like. Yet they are already talking about seeing each other. This is obvious they don’t care about you. It all about sex with them.</p>



<h2>Dating apps are not for unemployed people</h2>



<p>These apps have a lot of gold diggers in one place. Then any other online community. They can tell you are unemployed by looking at your pictures.</p>



<p>If they see you don’t have money. You won’t even get a reply. Some won’t even read your message. This why most get rejected on dating apps. you won’t have time to explain yourself. Once they visit your profile and see your picture. They judged you and there is nothing you can do.</p>



<p>If you want to survive, you must take your picture in high places. Your profile must interest enough.</p>

<p>There is no way we can control. When the right person will come into our lives. But we can make ourselves visible for all the possibilities.</p>



<p>If you are looking for a partner. You must expand your life and be creative. Hopefully, on that journey, you will find a lover of your life.</p>



<p>Find things you can do and enjoy. But increasing your chances of finds a partner. Things you rarely do. Even though you have an interest in them.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to take an invitation from your friends. But avoid hanging out with the same people all the time. This will get boring. If you hang out with the same people you. It must be different locations at least.</p>



<p>It can be a challenge to go to places where you don’t know anyone. But that where new friendship and fun will come from.</p>



<p>Choices are unlimited you can try –</p>



<ul><li>Gym</li><li>Visit coffee shops</li><li>Travel to new places</li><li>Visit jazz clubs</li><li>Church and more</li></ul>



<h2>Take the lead in trying new things</h2>



<p>If no one is inviting you to try new things. Don’t sit and wait, invite them yourself.<br>Even if after all this you don’t find a partner. You will still make new friends and you will have a good time doing it. This is a win, win process.<br>Taking a lead will not always mean you have to invite friends to certain events. You can also volunteer for any job or service that you can enjoy.<br>Everyone can meet someone. We need to be active and date ready.</p>



<h2>Loving your self first before finding love</h2>



<ul><li>Take yourself out</li><li>Buy yourself pleasant things</li></ul>



<ul><li>Celebrate yourself and more.</li></ul>



<p>The more you celebrate and love yourself. More people will find you attractive. If you don’t love yourself how can you expect someone to love you?<br>Loving and taking care of yourself. Will give the first impression to most people you meet. This increases your chances of finding someone.<br>This makes you proud of who you are and you also get respect.</p>



<h2>The right and the wrong places to get a lover</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="http://localhost/thefamilies/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="PLACES YOU CAN TRY, SO YOU CAN FIND A PARTNER" class="wp-image-1075" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Let be realistic, not all the places. You go to and have fun will lead you to the right partner.<br>Think about people you can attract from each place. Because certain people attend certain places. Don’t forget about age.<br><strong>For example: &#8211; </strong>if you love music and you would love to meet someone with the same interest. Attending music conferences nearby can be a good place to start. You will attract people with the same interest. While learning.</p>



<h3>Common places to meet a partner while having fun</h3>



<ul><li>Soft club with low or no music. Where it not crowded and you can talk. Without being distracted by people and music.</li><li>The grocery store. Though there isn’t that much fun in grocery stores. You can get a brilliant partner while shopping. Dress up look nice and clean. Don’t but everything same day. Visiting different stores can increase your chances. Pick stores wisely shopping in town and buying in malls is not the same.</li><li>Visit art galleries nearby can also be a great experience.</li><li>National gardens are wonderful too. Most people go there to clear their heads and available to have some talk.</li></ul>



<p>Look at yourself and understand your needs. Because there is a lot to do out there for different people.</p>



<h3>Terrible places for meeting partners</h3>



<p>Some places can be good for fun. But not for <a href="https://www.thefamilies.com/before-she-says-yes-to-a-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding a partner</a>.</p>



<ul><li>Places like stadiums during soccer games can be fun. But it loud and hard to have a decent conversation. Very few can pay attention to you. Everyone is talking and focusing on a soccer match.</li><li>Night clubs, some say they can be a good place to meet friends. I disagree with them. They can be risky and might attract criminals. People who are attending clubs. These are the people who rarely do well with commitment and loyalty. You can get lucky, but it not worth your time.</li><li>Libraries will also waste your time. No one is interested in talking to anyone. They are there for studies. Some will even have a sign of no talking.</li></ul>



<p>You still need to use your judgment and find what best for you.</p>



<h2>Lower your dating expectations</h2>



<p>I understand the entire purpose to put yourself out there is to meet someone. But lower your expectations because we don’t know. If you will find your partner this week, next month, or in a year.<br>If you have high expectations and you don’t find a partner soon. This can make you give up too early. It is about timing.<br>Put yourself out there and trust in God. Don’t forget to keep it safe and protect yourself from <a href="https://sacoronavirus.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">COVID-19</a>. Have fun God will do the rest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="384" src="http://localhost/thefamilies/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide1-1.jpg" alt="Should you make your kids apologize?" class="wp-image-1107" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide1-1.jpg 672w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide1-1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></figure></div>



<p>It a great practice to teach our kids to apologize. When our kids say I’m sorry they should mean it. We shouldn’t force our kids to apologize for the things they are not sorry for. But we must teach them to apologize and teach them not to over apologies.</p>



<p>Before we talk much about this one thing to remember. How your kids behave also affects your reputation. If your kids provoke people and don’t feel sorry for their actions. This says a lot about you as a parent.</p>



<p>Kids don’t like to be wrong and when they are wrong. They don’t like to admit they are wrong. If they must apologize, they try to fight it first or blame the other person. There is a lot to learn about <strong><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apologizing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the power of the apology.</a></strong></p>



<p>Forcing kids to say I’m sorry. You can increase anger and shame. This also makes them say sorry all the time without meaning it or changing their behavior.</p>



<h2>When to apologizing for your kids ‘</h2>



<p>Though I don’t enjoy apologizing for my kids. Sometimes kids can leave us with no choice. Especially if the problem involves someone older than your child. Also, when your child broke something and it needs to be paid for.</p>



<p>This will force you to act and take a responsibility for your child. Then later you can deal with your child. But there is no need to fight with your child. You must help them understand why what they did was wrong. Help them understand why they owe you an apology for fixing their problem. Your child must also promise it won’t happen again.</p>



<h2>When your child refuses to apologize</h2>



<p>You must always ask what happened first before telling your child to say I’m sorry. Get both sides of the story. Because sometimes the wrong kid can cry 1st. then a parent will tell the one that is not crying to apologize.</p>



<p>This can make the child refuse to apologize. Force a child to say I’m sorry will never be a good idea.</p>



<p>Even when your child refuses to apologize. You must not yale or get angry. The aim is to teach our kids to respect others. We also need to respect our kids and understand learning to apologize is a long process.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/what-are-the-worst-mistakes-parents-can-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The mistake parents do</a> </strong>is to forget kids are growing. Yelling will make your kids fear you. Once your kids fear you it gets even harder to teach them. Sometimes it damages them mentally.</p>



<p>If your child is still angry and refusing to apologize. Give them time to cool down and speak with them.</p>



<p>Apologizing is difficult, and it is hard to even for most adults. Most of them were not thought to apologize the right way growing up.</p>



<h2>Tips that can teach your kids to apologize</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="672" height="384" src="http://localhost/thefamilies/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-1.jpg" alt="Tips that can teach your kids to apologize" class="wp-image-1108" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-1.jpg 672w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide2-1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></figure></div>



<p>It is simple to apologize to your kids and those around you. When kids see you doing good, they will do the same.</p>



<p>Don’t force your kids to say I’m sorry. But help them understand how important it is to be sorry.</p>



<p>So that when they apologize it genuine and meaningful. This will also help them apologize, even when you are not around them.</p>



<h2>What is a humble apology?</h2>



<p>Our kids must understand apologizing doesn’t mean you are wrong. But you value your relationship with that person. Thus, they must be humble when they apologize. Because apologizing is not about them. It is about improving their friendship. The genuine apology will increase trust and authority.</p>



<p>Apologizing humble mean, you are truly sorry and you will do all that you could to make sure this won’t happen again.</p>



<h2>Why must kids learn to apologize?</h2>



<p>We need to teach our kids to apologize so they can protect their relationships with others.</p>



<p>The pleasant thing about kids learns to apologize at an early stage. They will use the same principles when they reach adult Hud.</p>



<p>Teaching kids to be sorry. Also, help them understand we all make mistakes. But we must take responsibility for our mistakes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mothers deserve better. Where it is a stepmother or bio mom. They both deserve better. But somehow most mothers’ days don’t always go the way you might hope for. Even as a stepmother you deserve to be treated specially on Mother’s Day. Because even though you are a stepmother, you still love your partner’s kids. You also do sacrifices for them. They need to show you they appreciate all this. Even though you are not the real mother.</p>



<h2>Lower your exceptions on a Mother’s Day</h2>



<p>The first step in avoiding Mother’s Day disappointment is to lower your expectations. Especially if you are a stepmother. Even if you know you sacrifice a lot for kids. You must lower your expectation. A lot can go wrong. Mother’s Day can make your The Stepkids miss their bio mom. While you on the other side expect them to show you love during this time.</p>



<p>I understand things we see on TV, Radio, Social Media, Etc. can make us jealous and feel like our kids don’t love you or appreciate you. Always keep in mind that every situation is different. Kids are different and parents. Some kids are still developing and some are fully grown. Some kids love you. But don’t know how to express their love to you yet. We all process things differently. Even us as a parent sometimes doesn’t express love the way we should.</p>



<p>My mother passed away when I was young, and my grandmother raised me. Even though my father was still present. My grandmother was the one taking care of me. Everything I needed, my father would pass money on to my grandmother. But she was the one who gets things done. Sometimes she didn’t even tell my dad. She would buy whatever I need with her mother. Yet, there was never a day on Mother’s Day. Where I did something for her to show that I appreciate her sacrifices. Am I proud of that? No, I did not understand she was special until I was grown. You must forget what happening around you. Focus on your situation.</p>



<h2>What role can father play on Mother’s Day?</h2>



<p>If you are a father, you must also play your part. She is raising your kids. You appreciate that. If your kids are not planning anything. It must be your job to ask them. <strong>“what should we do for your mother this Mother’s Day?” </strong>help your kids see the need to do something special for their mother. You can even help your kids with the present. Also, fund them if needed. But if they are working, that even better. Normalize showing your wife or girlfriend how special they are always.</p>



<h2>Celebrate yourself as a mother.</h2>



<p>It nice to be celebrated. There is that amazing feeling if someone shows you, they love you. But you must teach yourself to celebrate you before anyone else. If it is Mother’s Day and you know the important role you play in your kids’ life. You know you are a splendid mother and you are proud.<br>Celebrate yourself and be proud these kids have gone this far because of you. Don’t expect too much on others to go out there and celebrate you as a mother.</p>



<h2>Appreciate everything you get in a Mother’s Day</h2>



<p>Don’t be a picky mom. Learn to appreciate everything you get where it big or small. Be thankful because it the thought that counts. Even those small gifts come from a good heart. You might get the bigger present the following new, who knows?</p>

<p>You will have issues in your marriage and relationship. If you keep avoiding addressing your issues. This will create bigger problems in a long run.</p>



<p>If you experience issues in your relationship or marriage. normalize talking with your partner about them. Leaving them undressed will create doubt and anger about the relationship. The more issues you leave unaddressed. The bigger the bridge between you and your partner.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter how old is that problem. If it is still bothering you talk about it. This can help you in the healing process. Because once you talk to your partner and they give you their side of the story. This is when you can decide whether you still want to hold it against them or let go.</p>



<p>Get your partner’s side of the story. Will sometimes make you realize how wrong you were about the situation. If this happens. You must forgive yourself and your partner. Learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apologizing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the power of forgiveness for yourself and others</strong>.</a></p>



<p>Talking about your problems will not only help you in a healing process. This all builds a strong and lasting relationship. Create a strong connection in your relationship. You must never be in denial and avoid your issues. Problems will always be there; you need a good problem-solving skill. So, your relationship can always stay healthy.</p>



<p>Big warning though avoids making a big deal out of the small thing. Because I am saying you need to address things that bother you.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean everything, something you can forgive your partner. Without even talking about them, but if it keeps eating you inside. Then you can address it. Learn more about <a href="https://www.thefamilies.site/making-a-big-deal-out-of-the-small-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>making a big deal out of small things</strong>.</a></p>



<p>If something happened in your relationship. You need to know how did this impact you emotionally and physically. Did it also affect your partner or it you? If your partner is not addressing the issue. This doesn’t mean they are not hurting. Especially men like to be powerful people. That why most of the time they like to keep feelings to themselves. Then it keeps adding and adding until they can’t take anymore.</p>



<p>Men can wake up one day and tell you I don’t want this anymore. You won’t understand what happened. But it several things he did not address.</p>



<p>If you talk to your partner, they learn to open to you. Because your partner might hurt secretly. Even if he is hurting or you are hurting secretly. That anger will show itself one day. You might not even realize it connected to the previous unaddressed issues.</p>



<h2><strong>Old issues</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Your relationship will not grow until you learn to talk. Avoid creating distance in your relationship. If your partner brings up an old issue that has been bothering him or her. You must never ask them why they want to talk about it now. Because until you address it. It will keep affecting the relationship.</p>



<p>You must take this as the opportunity to fix the previous issue. Stop wondering why now, fix it and move on. Because if your partner brought something up. This means there is more they want you to understand.</p>



<p>Yes, you won’t be able to fix all your issues. But talking about them will make your partner see you care, and you are listening. So, talking can heal your partner even when there was no solution. Being heard alone means more. Because your partner now knows if this happens again you will know how to act.</p>



<p>Stop leaving issue undressed. It will never be good for your relationship.</p>

<p>We should forget such storms in your family. They must not be allowed to leave any hint of unfriendly will. Sometimes we take family fusses too seriously, the issue over them, and allow them to darken the family’s happiness.</p>



<p>A home must be a place where people bond together with their children, a place where parents love one another, place where the immature are protected and guarded, a place where one can rest and have privacy, and more.</p>



<p>Not a place where family member fight all the time.</p>

<p>Once you become an Ex, a lot of drama and confusion is involved. Should you block him? Should you continue supporting him? If I do what this means?</p>



<p>Today I’m going to help you deal with your ex the right way. Also, answer the question like. How do you know when it over? Do you still love your ex or you are just lonely?</p>



<p>There are many reasons you think about your ex.&nbsp; You might miss those late-night talk and if you haven’t found a new partner. You will miss your ex the most. Thinking about your ex doesn’t mean you must get back together. Sometimes you must move on. Because <strong>going back might hurt you even more.</strong></p>



<p>Accepting the relationship is over can be hard and the longer it takes, the harder it gets. After getting a new partner, it gets better. The thoughts of your ex will never be permanently forgotten. However, you will feel better after a few years. It like the death of someone we love. It gets hard, at the 1<sup>st</sup> until we learn to leave without them.</p>



<p>If you think about your ex. Yet you don’t think they deserve a second chance. It helps to spend more time with family and friends. Until you find someone.</p>



<p>Failing to find a new relationship will make you think about your ex even more. Don’t be stuck in your past, because it would be all you see. You can still find someone new. That will value and respect you.</p>



<p>There is a reason your last relationship ended. Don’t forget about those reasons. History always repeats itself, if we keep going back to your past.</p>



<p>If we are in a relationship, we follow certain patterns. Sometimes we miss things we did with our exes, not necessarily them.&nbsp; If you are lucky to find someone new, who will teach you new patterns. That when we forget the old ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missing your ex means you are lonely, and you haven’t found a new life. Which will close the gap for your old life.</p>



<p>It is hard to understand. If you miss your ex or just having someone to spend quality time with. Or you just miss sex.</p>



<p>However, it also possible you are still in love with your ex. If you made a quick decision without thinking it through. Sometimes we end relationships just to avoid solving problems.</p>



<p>If that the case, your mind knows you ended the relationship without good reasoning. Your relationship can still work, you just need to put pride aside and solve your problems.</p>



<p>But there must never be a day when you try so hard to get your ex back. Doing this will give your ex more power and they might take you for granted. Even when you are truly in love with your ex. Wait until they prove they still have the attention in a relationship.</p>



<h2>What do you do if you still like your ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="288" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/still-like-your-ex.jpg" alt="still like your ex" class="wp-image-1212" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/still-like-your-ex.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/still-like-your-ex-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Some relationships can end while you are still in love. If this happens, it can be hard to move on. Not because you cannot move on. You don’t want to move on. Maybe you still wish your ex can come back and apologize.</p>



<p>This can make you feel stuck in your past relationship. The worse thing that can happen, your ex might never apologize. If you still love you ex, yet no chance of a rebound. You must first accept it over. If you don’t accept it ended. You won’t think about what to do next.</p>



<p>You will keep thinking about what if you did things differently. Maybe the outcome would be different. Which is true, but you didn’t accept it. It takes two people to be in a relationship. If one is no longer be part of it, then it no longer a relationship.</p>



<p>The only time I can advise you to go after your ex, is when your ex haven’t moved on too. They are not involved in a new relationship and they are still in contact you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But going after your ex when they have moved on. Can put you in a very painful position. You can also talk to your friends and family members. People who knew your relationship very well. Ask for advice on what to do. If they know the relationship is not good for you, they will tell you.</p>



<p>Loving yourself and opening up to a new life. Will help you move your focus away from your ex. Make your breakup the opportunity to do new things. You couldn’t do it in a relationship.</p>



<p>When the breakup is still new. You will think about all the bad things about your ex. When time goes by you think about the wonderful memories. That when you will miss your ex the more. But just because you are thinking about the good times. Doesn’t mean your partner is good for you.</p>



<p>Going back to your ex just because you have the old wonderful memories. Does not mean all those good things will happen again if you get back together.</p>



<h2>Why do exes contact you out of the blue?</h2>



<p>Should I call back my ex? Your ex can contact you for different reasons. The best way to understand is to talk to them. Even though you can ignore him/her. Maybe you want peace in your life.</p>



<p>Some exes are lonely and want to have a conversation. Sometimes when they go through a hard time. They want support from you. Especially if they haven’t found a new partner to replace you.</p>



<p>It is totally up to you to answer or call back your ex. If you still have feeling and the reason for a breakup are not that bad. Why not! But if you feel they don’t deserve your time, then don’t give them attention.</p>



<h2>Does dreaming of an ex mean they miss you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="288" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dreaming-of-your.jpg" alt="dreaming of your ex" class="wp-image-1211" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dreaming-of-your.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dreaming-of-your-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Dreaming about your ex will make you question yourself. Do I still love my ex? If you have a new relationship. It will feel you are betraying your new partner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex can mean two things. You miss your ex or your ex misses you. Most cases if you thought about your ex before you went to sleep. There is a high chance you might dream of your ex that night.</p>



<p>If your ex thinks or talks about you. The universe can hear that and talk to you back with a dream.&nbsp; This is why we dream about most recent events more often.</p>



<p>Dreaming about your ex giving you advice. Your mind is telling not to repeat same mistakes you did with your ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dreaming of your ex death doesn’t mean your ex is dying. But your feelings for the old relationship are dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h2>Can exes fall back in love?</h2>



<p>Yes, your ex can fall back in love with you and it happens more than you might think.</p>



<p>If they lost no dignity in your breakup. It is still possible to get back together and still possible your ex misses you too.</p>



<p>This will also depend on the age of your relationship. If you and your ex have a lot of history together. It won’t be easy to move on for any of you.</p>



<p>But <strong>your relationship ended for a reason don’t forget</strong>. If your relationship with your ex was in an excellent position or healthy. It wouldn’t have ended in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Before you make your ex fall back in love. You must think of every problem you were having in your relationship. Think if they can be solvable or not. If your relationship had serious problems like <strong>cheating and abuse</strong>. Forget about that relationship, <strong>just forget</strong>.</p>



<p>But if your ex was bringing value in your life. Yet, you didn’t realize how much your ex was helping you. Now that your relationship is over. Your life is not complete anymore.</p>



<p>Think of everything you did which made you ex to fall out. Fix your self 1<sup>st</sup> before you go back to apologize. The only way to make your ex fall back. Will begin by you admitting all your mistakes and making sure you don’t repeat them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exes often come back but don’t wait for your ex. They might not come back.</p>



<h2>How do you know if an ex misses you?</h2>



<p>How do you know if your ex secretly misses you? Most of us will use a breakup as a time to heal. Once we heal, we may miss our old relationship.</p>



<p>But even when we miss our exes, sometimes pride can kick in. We wait for them to miss us too.</p>



<h3>If one of these things happens. Then your ex could be missing you.</h3>



<ul><li>If your ex blocked you on a breakup and recently unblocked you.</li><li>If your ex finds random excuses to contact you.</li><li>Start asking about you in your friends and family.</li><li>Call you or text you when they are drunk.</li><li>Start stalking you on social media.</li><li>Your ex is always happy to see you.</li><li>Remembers your birthdays.</li><li>Give your kids some money.</li></ul>



<p>These can be clues that your ex is missing you. But do you miss your ex? Your ex can miss you, yet if you have moved on. Don’t go back.</p>



<h2>Do exes come back after months?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="288" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/exes-ccome-back-after-months.jpg" alt="exes come back after months" class="wp-image-1210" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/exes-ccome-back-after-months.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/exes-ccome-back-after-months-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Most of the time they will. Removing someone in your mind is difficult. Some forget after a few months, for some, it gets harder. &nbsp;Sometimes we have 0 control of our memories.</p>



<p>Most of the time your ex will come back after seeing you dating someone else. Seeing you with someone else can make your ex jealous.&nbsp; If you are in a new relationship. They feel like someone is winning something that belongs to them.</p>



<p>But if your ex date someone else quickly after a breakup. They might not come back. The only time they will come back is when. This new relationship they started is not what they hoped for.</p>



<p>If they also celebrated the breakup publicly. Even when they miss you, the chances of them coming back are too small.</p>



<p>Sometimes your ex will get back to you, just to prove a point. Or if you used to support your ex. They might miss you when they face tough times.</p>



<p>If your ex comes back after months. It can be a good thing or he/she is coming back with more problems.</p>



<h2>Should you keep supporting your ex?</h2>



<p>Stop supporting your ex after a breakup. Just stop! If you are no longer in a relationship. That person is no longer your responsibility.</p>



<p>Whether you support your ex emotional or financial. It is not your place to do that. Let your ex go, <strong>either they are with you or they are not.</strong></p>



<p>Stop trying to make yourself look important. You are just forcing yourself in a place you don’t belong to.</p>



<p>Even if your ex is the one coming back for support. Keep in mind, they deserve nothing. They left you!</p>



<h2>Does silence make an ex miss you?</h2>



<p>Silence can make a man miss you. But not all men!</p>



<p>Silence can also make a man move on, from his past relationship.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, silence can work but there are no guarantees. <strong>A lot can happen while you are silent</strong>. You also have no right to blame him, since you went silent.</p>



<p>But it always a good idea to lay low sometimes. This helps you avoid saying things you don’t mean. Just go silent make your ex wonder why you don’t give them attention anymore. Have you found someone or you really don’t have a feeling for them anymore?</p>



<p>Silence will make your exes realize your absence and start missing. But this can also trigger him to look for a new partner. Since your exes are now feeling lonely.</p>



<p>You can cut a guy off and let him miss you. Don’t give him too much space though if you still love him. Because he will develop new patterns without you.</p>



<p>If you want to stop talking to your ex. So, your ex can miss you, know it does not end there. You still need to do more to make sure your plan works. Try this</p>



<ul><li>Keep in contact with your ex family members. Even though you don’t talk to your ex.</li><li>Don’t block your ex on social media. Make your ex see everything you are up too.</li><li>Invest in yourself, go out, and have fun.</li></ul>



<p>These can help if you want your ex to miss you. Yet you don’t want to talk to him yet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Can you stay a friend with an ex?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="288" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/staying-friends-with-an-ex.jpg" alt="staying friends with an ex" class="wp-image-1209" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/staying-friends-with-an-ex.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/staying-friends-with-an-ex-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>People ask this question a lot. The reason they want to stay friends with their ex. They still care about them and enjoy their company.</p>



<p>If you also feel this way, I have a question for you. <strong>If you still enjoy each other’s company, why did you break up?</strong></p>



<p>Why didn’t you both fix your problem instead of breaking up?</p>



<p>Because if you breakup with someone. It means you want nothing to do with them. But this is not a simple question to answer. I think it can really depend on you and what you want.</p>



<p>Someone who cheated on you, can not expect you to be friends with them after a breakup. However, if the breakup was just a small miss understanding. It&#8217;s understandable to remain friends. It still depends on how big are your problems and can they be fixed.</p>



<p>But if you or your ex have new partners. Staying friends is a no go!</p>



<p>Since the relationship end for a reason. Staying a friend with your ex can also take away your time to heal. It is also a disrespect to your new relationship.</p>



<h2>Why do guys act like they don&#8217;t care after a breakup?</h2>



<p><strong>Sometimes they are not acting, they really don’t care</strong>. If you care about someone you do everything to keep them. If you still act like you don’t care about a breakup. Then you didn’t deserve that relationship in the 1<sup>st</sup> place.</p>



<p>Stop following your ex if you see they don’t care after a breakup. Move back and force on you.</p>



<p>Once someone becomes your ex, they need not explain themselves to you. Because you are no longer together. <strong>That why they say what yours will always come to you.</strong></p>



<p>If your ex doesn’t come back after a breakup. The relationship was never yours. Move on, you will find someone new. There is no person who is better than everyone. You can always find someone who is better than your ex. Don’t be stuck with people who treat you like you mean nothing to them.</p>



<h2>Reason to take a break after a breakup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="288" src="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/healing-after-a-breakup.jpg" alt="healing after a breakup" class="wp-image-1208" srcset="https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/healing-after-a-breakup.jpg 768w, https://www.thefamilies.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/healing-after-a-breakup-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>There are many reasons you should heal. After a failed relationship. Many of us jump into the next relationship. With hope, it will heal the past relationship. However, in most cases, it doesn’t. taking a break can be good for your mental health.</p>



<p>Jumping to the next relationship can replace pain with happiness. But it won’t heal you, once your new relationship slows down. You will feel more pain. You might even regret your decision. Going back is no longer a wise choice.</p>



<p>If your new relationship fails. You are now facing pain for two relationship. Which both didn’t work.</p>



<p>Not allowing yourself to heal can create a lot of problems. <strong>Like trust issues, anger, insecurities, etc</strong>.</p>



<p>Moving on without healing can negatively affect your emotions and the way you think.</p>



<p>Breakups can be a trauma no matter what side you are on.</p>



<h3>Recovering after a breakup</h3>



<p>Some break up can be bad. But you need to pick yourself up and move on. Your life doesn’t end in a breakup, there is still a lot you can accomplish.</p>



<p>Recovering also mean you finding the right partner the next time. Not repeating the same patterns of bad partners.</p>



<ul><li>In the first step, focus on helping yourself. Getting professional help if you feel your need one, talking to your family members. Talking to your friends asking them what to do in your situation. Reaching out to people who recently recovered from relationship fail, and more. You know who are your good friends and best family members are. Because not everyone knows you and understands you.</li><li>Teach yourself that it is okay to feel pain after a breakup. The pain is not permanent, and it is not the end of your world. You are in control and you have the power to take yourself out of that pain.</li><li>Take some time and point out what did you do wrong. So, you can start learning from your mistakes and avoid them as early as possible in your next relationship. Learn what made you pick this person and what was good about him. What was bad about him or what was bad about you both in your past relationship? Makes sure you get all the fact right before you start a new relationship. I cannot guarantee your next relationship will work out. But you will avoid most problems from your previous relationship.</li><li>Don’t contact each other unless there are kids involved. But if you don’t have kids with your ex. There is no need to follow your ex on social media or keeping in touch. Because you will be starting noticing things your ex is doing right. Which can make you fall in love and forget why you guy broke up in the first place.&nbsp;</li><li>The experiment has fun and put yourself out there. Try new things, try a new life. Make yourself available not only to a new partner. But new friends also. Everything new can be exciting, which can help you heal faster. The more you try new things, the faster you will move away from your past.</li><li>Regain confidence and trust in yourself. Just believe you can gain anything that you want. You need not settle for less and keep going back to people who hurt you. Trust yourself you can move on and get everything that you want. It is a process but when you know what you want. Eventual it will come to you.</li><li>Maintain your dignity after a breakup. Don’t be a person who keeps begging for a relationship. No need to always try to fix your relationship. Especially if you see your partner don’t care anymore. If someone makes up their decision that they no longer want to be in a relationship with you. Stop fighting it and accept their decision. Begging to make you look desperate, which makes your partner lose attraction even more. You are going to be okay regardless of what is happening in your life.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>How do you tell she&#8217;s not over her ex?</h2>



<p>Dating someone who is not over his ex is painful. But how can you tell if your new girlfriend is not over her ex?</p>



<h3>These can be signs she is not over her ex.</h3>



<ul><li>She keeps making excuses to visit you.</li><li>She talks about her past relationship a lot.</li><li>She still keeps in contact with her ex.</li><li>She gets angry at you for no reason.</li><li>Never enjoy sex with you.</li><li>Always treating you, she will leave the relationship.</li><li>She doesn’t want to meet your family.</li></ul>



<h2>Should you take back an ex who dumped you?</h2>



<p>If you still love them you can, but if you have moved on don’t.</p>



<p>Because this means whatever they thought they were doing didn’t work. Now they are coming back to you as a backup plane.</p>



<p>You need someone who will be full committed to you.</p>



<p>Not someone who will come and go when it suits him/her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Who hurts more after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Women are more sensitive than man. They also sacrifice a lot in a relationship then most men. They even sacrifice their family just to be with you.</p>



<p>Very few men can move out of their home just to be with a woman.</p>



<p>If a woman enters a relationship. They enter with everything they have.</p>



<p>If the relationship doesn’t work, it is safe to say. Women will hurt the most.</p>



<h2>Who moves on faster after a breakup?</h2>



<p>Man can move on before a breakup. By the time the relationship gets in to a break up they are long gone. Sometimes by the time they end the relationship. They are already involved a new one.</p>



<p>While women on the other hand. Needs some time to heal after a break. It can take them a very long time to heal.&nbsp; Sometimes it even takes years for a woman to move on.</p>



<p>The only time man will have a hard time moving on after a breakup. Will only be a time where he fails to find a better partner. Which will replace the old one.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, even though men move on faster. This does not mean they don’t miss you, or they are not hurting over the past relationship. They do but they don’t allow the pain to control them.</p>



<h2>Why people get stuck after breakup?</h2>



<p>People sometime get stuck with they ex. Even though they know the relationship was not good for them.</p>



<h3>These can be the reasons they are stuck.</h3>



<ul><li>They get in denial, they know relationship was not good for them. Yet they keep think it can be fixed. But they failed to fix it.</li><li>Thinking their happiness belong to their ex-partner. That without their ex, they can’t have a good time.</li><li>Hold on to the old promises.</li><li>Focusing too much on the great time they both shared. Not willing to try new things.</li><li>Busy asking themselves why me, instead of asking. What did I learn from this?</li><li>Comparing their life to someone else’s life.</li><li>Staying in contact with their ex.</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Most of my advice are based on my past experience. However, how you treat your ex is total up to you.</p>



<p>But if your keep making the wrong decisions there will be consequence. Those results can make you hurt repeatedly.</p>



<p>If you find yourself hurting by a same person repeatedly. This means you must look back into your decisions. Try to understand what role are you playing. How can you get yourself out?</p>



<p>Don’t allow more pain in your life. If it doesn’t work, try new things that works. Stop trying things that can’t be fixed and love yourself. Because you deserve all the good things like everyone else.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
